                        <p class="p noindent ">THE following interesting letter is from a 
                           native African, who, when quite a child, 
                           was kidnapped from the interior of Nubia. 
                           and after being several times sold, finally fell 
                           into the hands of an English family at 
                           Alexandria, where he acquired the rudiments 
                           of education, namely, a knowledge of the 
                           English alphabet. After remaining with 
                           this family for some time, he came to Eng- 
                           land in the capacity of servant; and having 
                           undergone many vicissitudes, at length went 
                           out to Lagos, to try what he could do on his 
                           own account. By his good conduct and ex- 
                           cellent principles, his sobriety, industry, and 
                           perseverance, he gained the confidence of 
                           the parties to whom he had been recom- 
                           mended, and his name is honourably mentioned 
                           in the despatches of Captain Burton, whom 
                           he accompanied on his recent visit to the 
                           King of Dahomey, and who has again en- 
                           gaged him for his present expedition. We 
                           have received other communications from 
                           him, from time to time, but they were strictly 
                           personal. Tlhe present one appears to us to 
                           offer sufficient interest to merit a place in 
                           our columns, and we print it without correc- 
                           tion.

                        <br><p class="p  ">"<span class="smallcaps ">Respected Sir</span>,-Your kind favour of the 
                           14th August came to hand on my return from 
                           the Congo River, to which place I accompanied 
                           Consul Burton last July. The condition of that 
                           country, as far as we ascended, viz. 160 miles 
                           into the interior, is in a most deplorable state. 
                           The slave-trade and its accompaniments have 
                           been, and still are, ruling rampant in that river; 
                           and the result is a thorough demoralization of 
                           the inhabitants. The copious drafts of rum and 
                           other luxuries, showered upon the people by the 
                           Portuguese slave-traders, has made them so 
                           thoroughly idle, that the earth groans for the 
                           want of some one to cultivate it. We found the 
                           poor victims to the influence of the vile traffic 
                           entirely in the hands of Satan; for thefts and 
                           debauchery of every description are rife through- 
                           out the whole country, but more especially from 
                           Shark Point, the mouth of the river, to Em- 
                           bomma, some eighty miles in the interior. Along 
                           the whole of the line are established baracoons 
                           and factories of every size and description. At 
                           some of these I saw plenty of slaves, and more 
                           particularly at one house in Embomma, where 
                           the unfortunate wretches were put in irons, 
                           awaiting the first opportunity of being sent down 
                           to the coast. I cannot give you a better exam- 
                           ple than this. We found, in the lower part of 
                           the river, the weaker sex awfully given to 
                           drunkenness, and, although nominally acknow- 
                           ledged by some one as their husband, they are

                           in reality nothing but common property. I have 
                           now travelled through the greater part of West 
                           Africa, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the 
                           Gold Coast, Dahomey, Lagos, Badagry, Porto 
                           Novo, and for 400 miles into the interior of the 
                           Euroba, or Yoruba country, the Benin, the 
                           Nun, the Brass, New Calabar, Bonny, Old Ca- 
                           labar, Cameroons, Fernando Po, Gaboon, and 
                           St. Paul's de Loando. I have visited Africans 
                           in their most primitive condition; but never in 
                           the whole of my experience did any thing like 
                           the state of affairs in the Congo River ever pre- 
                           sent itself to my notice. I am happy to say, 
                           however, that Her Majesty's cruisers are doing 
                           their utmost to suppress this market for human 
                           blood. When we left the mouth of the Congo 
                           last October, the Zebra, the Archer, the Griffin, 
                           the Lee, and the Afulet, were on duty there, so 
                           that we hope, ere long, to hear that the Portu- 
                           guese are ultimately compelled to leave the river. 
                           I hear that, according to present arrangements, 
                           the power of Portugal ought not to extend be- 
                           yond Ambrizette, forty miles south of the Zaire, 
                           or Congo. If so, they ought to be turned out 
                           of the river by force; for so long as they exer- 
                           cise their influence over the natives, no legiti- 
                           mate commerce can be established with them. 
                           Messrs.- and - is the only English 
                           house in the river, and I am sorry to say that 
                           it is a failure; for, encouraged on every point 
                           by the slave-traders, the native chiefs find 
                           it more profitable to catch men and sell them 
                           for plenty of rum and beads and cloth, than to 
                           spoil their fingers by the manufacture of palm- 
                           oil. In fact, I cannot see how a profitable traffic 
                           in native produce can be carried on unless the 
                           slave-traders were driven out, and the river 
                           shut up for two or three years, to purge it 
                           from the effects produced by the vile system ex- 
                           isting in its bosom. In about five or six days 
                           I hope to accompany Captain Burton (by whom 
                           I am now employed) to the Court of the Da- 
                           homey King. This will be our second visit to 
                           that country; and, from my slight experience 
                           of the country and people, I think Captain Bur- 
                           ton is just the right man in the right place.
                        </p> 
                        
                        <p class="p  ">"Many thanks for the receipts, which came 
                           to hand all safe, as also the copies of the Re- 
                           porter. The subscribers are quite delighted with 
                           the news, and wonder they had never heard of 
                           the Society before this. As the subject has now 
                           been introduced to their notice, I hope they will 
                           keep up the communication regularly with home; 
                           and I see no reason why all the intelligent na- 
                           tives on the coast should not become subscribers. 
                           I am sorry to say that the present system of 
                           education on the coast is not calculated to raise 
                           the natives much beyond their former scale of 
                           usefulness. There are only two things that they 
                           are educated for, viz. clerks and merchants. 
                           Everybody cannot be a merchant. Why not 
                           encourage agriculture? The same money that
                           makes the merchant can make the farmer, and 
                           I must confess that the latter would be the most 
                           independent of the two; for, singular to relate, 
                           that the prejudice of the native against the 
                           European, and, vice versa, of the European 
                           against the native, is any thing but encourag- 
                           ing. The natives have great capacities for 
                           trade; but the goods supplied to them on the 
                           coast are invoiced at such high prices, that it is 
                           really impossible for them to, realize any thing 
                           for themselves. To prove this, I have only to 
                           mention the case of Mr. - , one of our 
                           subscribers. Last year he paid in something 
                           like 800l. (Eight hundred pounds) sterling 
                           as his yearly trade account with Messrs.- 
                           and - . Out of this he received commission 
                           about fifty pounds with which to maintain himself,
                           his wife, and the Kroo- boys, besides a nephew and 
                           four children. Had it not been that Mr. 
                           - had other sources to depend upon, his 
                           brokerage between the Europeans and natives 
                           would never keep his house in more than dr)y 
                           bread and water. He begged of me to recom- 
                           mend him to some gentleman in England with 
                           whom he could deal<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.

                           worth of palm-oil, his own private property; 
                           and I should feel truly grateful if you will put 
                           him in the way of trading direct with England. 
                           He intends shipping some of his oil the moment 
                           he receives a communication from you. As for 
                           myself, I must candidly confess that I have 
                           found it more profitable for the present to be 
                           travelling about. That, however, cannot last, 
                           for, sooner or later, I must settle down somewhere. 
                           There are already too many engaged in palm- 
                           oil ; I therefore think of starting a cotton plan- 
                           tation at the foot of the Cameroon mountains as 
                           soon as my period of servitude with my present 
                           employer has expired. Two or three thousand 
                           acres taken in and sown with cotton would not 
                           require more than 3501. to 4001. out here, and, 
                           from experiments already tried, the farm could 
                           be made self-supporting after the first year. I 
                           do not think we shall be more than three months 
                           in Dahomey, after which I think my master goes 
                           to England, and then I shall be at liberty to try 
                           for myself. I enclose a sample of cotton which 
                           I have grown this year in the Consular grounds. 
                           There are about two acres sowed with cotton, 
                           and I expect to gather about three cwt. With 
                           many thanks for your kind wishes,
                        </p>

                              and after being several times sold, finally fell

                              <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Alexandria</span>, where he acquired the rudiments 
                              of education, namely, a knowledge of the 
                              <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> alphabet. After remaining with 
                              this family for some time, he came to 
                              <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> in the capacity of servant; and having 
                              undergone many vicissitudes, at length went 
                              out to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lagos</span>, to try what he could do on his 
                              own account. By his good conduct and 
                              excellent principles, his sobriety, industry, and 
                              perseverance, he gained the confidence of 
                              the parties to whom he had been 
                              recommended, and his name is honourably mentioned 
                              in the despatches of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Burton</span>, whom 
                              he accompanied on his recent visit to the

                              him, from time to time, but they were strictly 
                              personal. The present one appears to us to 
                              offer sufficient interest to merit a place in

                           <br><p class="p  ">"<span class="smallcaps ">Respected Sir</span>,—Your kind favour of the 
                              <span class="">14th August</span> came to hand on my return from 
                              the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo River</span>, to which place I accompanied 
                              <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Consul Burton</span> last <span class="">July</span>. The condition of that 
                              country, as far as we ascended, viz. 160 miles 
                              into the interior, is in a most deplorable state. 
                              The slave-trade and its accompaniments have 
                              been, and still are, ruling rampant in that river; 
                              and the result is a thorough demoralization of 
                              the inhabitants. The copious drafts of rum and 
                              other luxuries, showered upon the people by the 
                              <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Portuguese slave-traders</span>, has made them so 
                              thoroughly idle, that the earth groans for the 
                              want of some one to cultivate it. We found the 
                              poor victims to the influence of the vile traffic 
                              entirely in the hands of Satan; for thefts and 
                              debauchery of every description are rife 
                              throughout the whole country, but more especially from 
                              <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Shark Point</span>, the mouth of the river, to 
                              <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Embomma</span>, some eighty miles in the interior. Along 
                              the whole of the line are established baracoons 
                              and factories of every size and description. At 
                              some of these I saw plenty of slaves, and more 
                              particularly at one house in <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Embomma</span>, where 
                              the unfortunate wretches were put in irons, 
                              awaiting the first opportunity of being sent down 
                              to the coast. I cannot give you a better 
                              example than this. We found, in the lower part of 
                              the river, the weaker sex awfully given to 
                              drunkenness, and, although nominally 
                              acknowledged by some one as their husband, they are

                              beyond <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ambrizette</span>, forty miles south of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zaire</span>, 
                              or <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>. If so, they ought to be turned out 
                              of the river by force; for so long as they 
                              exercise their influence over the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span>, no 
                              legitimate commerce can be established with them. 
                              <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Messrs. —— and ——</span> is the only <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> 
                              house in the river, and I am sorry to say that 
                              it is a failure; for, encouraged on every point 
                              by the slave-traders, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native chiefs</span> find 
                              it more profitable to catch men and sell them 
                              for plenty of rum and beads and cloth, than to 
                              spoil their fingers by the manufacture of palm-oil. 
                              In fact, I cannot see how a profitable traffic 
                              in <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> produce can be carried on unless the 
                              slave-traders were driven out, and the river 
                              shut up for two or three years, to purge it 
                              from the effects produced by the vile system 
                              existing in its bosom. In about five or six days 
                              I hope to accompany <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain Burton</span> (by whom 
                              I am now employed) to the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Court of the 
                                 <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person."><span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span> King</span></span>. This will be our second visit to 
                              that country; and, from my slight experience 
                              of the country and people, I think <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Captain 
                                 Burton</span> is just the right man in the right place.
                           </p> 
                           
                           <p class="p  ">"Many thanks for the receipts, which came 
                              to hand all safe, as also the copies of the 
                              <span class="italic ">Reporter</span>. The subscribers are quite delighted with 
                              the news, and wonder they had never heard of 
                              the <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Society</span> before this. As the subject has now 
                              been introduced to their notice, I hope they will 
                              keep up the communication regularly with home; 
                              and I see no reason why all the intelligent 
                              natives on the coast should not become subscribers. 
                              I am sorry to say that the present system of 
                              education on the coast is not calculated to raise 
                              the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> much beyond their former scale of 
                              usefulness. There are only two things that they 
                              are educated for, viz. clerks and merchants. 
                              Everybody cannot be a merchant. Why not 
                              encourage agriculture? The same money that
                              
                              makes the merchant can make the farmer, and 
                              I must confess that the latter would be the most 
                              independent of the two; for, singular to relate, 
                              that the prejudice of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span> against the 
                              <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span>, and, <span class="italic ">vice versâ</span>, of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">European</span> 
                              against the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">native</span>, is any thing but 
                              encouraging. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> have great capacities for 
                              trade; but the goods supplied to them on the 
                              coast are invoiced at such high prices, that it is 
                              really impossible for them to, realize any thing 
                              for themselves. To prove this, I have only to 
                              mention the case of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. ——</span>, one of our 
                              subscribers. Last year he paid in something 
                              like 800<span class="italic ">l</span>. (Eight hundred pounds) sterling 
                              as his yearly trade account with <span class="orgName" title="A formally-named group or organization.">Messrs.—— 
                                 and ——</span>. Out of this he received commission 
                              about fifty pounds with which to maintain himself,
                              his wife, and the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kroo-boys</span>, besides a nephew and 
                              four children. Had it not been that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. 
                                 ——</span> had other sources to depend upon, his 
                              brokerage between the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Europeans</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">natives</span> 
                              would never keep his house in more than dry 
                              bread and water. He begged of me to 
                              recommend him to some gentleman in <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span> with 
                              whom he could deal<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.

                              worth of palm-oil, his own private property; 
                              and I should feel truly grateful if you will put 
                              him in the way of trading direct with <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>. 
                              He intends shipping some of his oil the moment 
                              he receives a communication from you. As for 
                              myself, I must candidly confess that I have 
                              found it more profitable for the present to be 
                              travelling about. That, however, cannot last, 
                              for, sooner or later, I must settle down somewhere. 
                              There are already too many engaged in 
                              palm-oil; I therefore think of starting a cotton 
                              plantation at the foot of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="country" title="A country.">Cameroon</span> mountains</span> as 
                              soon as my period of servitude with my present 
                              employer has expired. Two or three thousand 
                              acres taken in and sown with cotton would not 
                              require more than 350<span class="italic ">l</span>. to 400<span class="italic ">l</span>. out here, and, 
                              from experiments already tried, the farm could 
                              be made self-supporting after the first year. I 
                              do not think we shall be more than three months 
                              <span class="country" title="A country."><span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Dahomey</span></span>, after which I think my master goes 
                              to <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, and then I shall be at liberty to try 
                              for myself. I enclose a sample of cotton which 
                              I have grown this year in the <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Consular grounds</span>. 
                              There are about two acres sowed with cotton, 
                              and I expect to gather about three cwt. With 
                              many thanks for your kind wishes,
                           </p>

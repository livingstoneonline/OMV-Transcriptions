                        functionary of the <span class="country" title="A country.">Independent Congo State</span> was a singular 
                        one to me. But <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Stanley</span> pointed out that I should have a 
                        privileged position; that the <span class="country" title="A country.">State</span> on its side could only 
                        gain by seeing its establishments on the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region."><span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Upper Congo</span></span> 
                        supported by the authority which for many years past I 
                        had acquired over the people of the interior, who all knew 
                        me through having traded with me ; while,as regarded 
                        myself, I could not but strengthen my commercial relations 
                        by means of the support which the <span class="country" title="A country.">Congo State</span> would 
                        afford to me, as to all who were established on its 
                        territory.

                     <p class="p  ">"I perceived the justice of these arguments, and I had, 
                        moreover, at heart to remedy, as far as I could, the 
                        mischief which the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span> and the population at the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> 
                        had done in destroying the station at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Stanley Falls</span>. This 
                        act was the result of misunderstanding and imprudence; but 
                        I do not think that I can refuse to make reparation if, as 
                        I believe, I can do so."

                     <p class="p  ">"The circumstances under which trade is carried on 
                        with the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">East <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Coast">coast</span></span> are no longer so favourable as some 
                        years back, when I commenced trading with <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> and 
                        abroad. Trade at that period had, so to speak, no 
                        existence. I established myself at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Houron</span>, near <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span>, 
                        with my old father and my brother <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mohamed Massoudi</span>, 
                        wishing first to create in the neigbbourhood plantations 
                        yielding satisfactory returns, and above all to monopolize 
                        the ivory trade by establishing <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> correspondents 
                        throughout <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>, on the shores of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lakes</span>, 
                        and as far <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span>. The people of the centre, who 
                        had no means of disposing of their considerable stocks of 
                        ivory, let me have them at a price which enabled me to 
                        realize a large profit. In a short time I had monopolized 
                        nearly all the sources of ivory production, 
                        and all the trade of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Manyema</span> was in my hands.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"The great difficulty has always been to bring the 
                        produce of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> to the markets of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span> and 
                        <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. At first this was easy enough, but gradually 
                        the people of the centre became aware that they could
                        also gain something by my operations, and commenced 
                        imposing heavy tribute upon me for right of way through 
                        their territories. For instanoe, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Wa-Kundis</span>, who 
                        alone possess the boats necessary for crossing the 
                        <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Malagarazi</span>, exact exorbitant terms for the use of them. 
                        Certain tribes sometimes attacked my caravans, causing 
                        me heavy loss in men and merchandise.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"Even on the coast the conditions of trade changed. 
                        The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Germans</span> were everywhere, and their pretentions 
                        rendered business more and more difficult. Great 
                        difficulties arose from this state of things, and on all these 
                        grounds I concluded that if the trade of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> 
                        could follow another route and reach the coast by sure 
                        roads on which no tribute would have to be paid, and 
                        where no difficulties were to be apprhended, everybody 
                        would be the gainer. After what I have seea at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Banana</span> 
                        and <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Boma</span> I believe I am not mistaken, and that traders 
                        like myself can only gain by dispatching their produce 
                        from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span> by way of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> and the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>."

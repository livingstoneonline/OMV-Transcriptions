                           by means of the support which the <span class="country" title="A country.">Congo State</span> would 
                           afford to me, as to all who were established on its

                        <p class="p  ">"The circumstances under which trade is carried on 
                           with the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">East <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Coast">coast</span></span> are no longer so favourable as some 
                           years back, when I commenced trading with <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> and 
                           abroad. Trade at that period had, so to speak, no 
                           existence. I established myself at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Houron</span>, near <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span>, 
                           with my old father and my brother <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mohamed Massoudi</span>, 
                           wishing first to create in the neigbbourhood plantations 
                           yielding satisfactory returns, and above all to monopolize 
                           the ivory trade by establishing <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> correspondents 
                           throughout <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span>, on the shores of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lakes</span>, 
                           and as far <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span>. The people of the centre, who 
                           had no means of disposing of their considerable stocks of 
                           ivory, let me have them at a price which enabled me to 
                           realize a large profit. In a short time I had monopolized 
                           nearly all the sources of ivory production, 
                           and all the trade of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Manyema</span> was in my hands.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="p  ">"The great difficulty has always been to bring the 
                           produce of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> to the markets of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Tabora</span> and 
                           <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. At first this was easy enough, but gradually 
                           the people of the centre became aware that they could
                           also gain something by my operations, and commenced 
                           imposing heavy tribute upon me for right of way through 
                           their territories. For instanoe, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Wa-Kundis</span>, who 
                           alone possess the boats necessary for crossing the 
                           <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Malagarazi</span>, exact exorbitant terms for the use of them. 
                           Certain tribes sometimes attacked my caravans, causing 
                           me heavy loss in men and merchandise.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="p  ">"Even on the coast the conditions of trade changed. 
                           The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Germans</span> were everywhere, and their pretentions 
                           rendered business more and more difficult. Great 
                           difficulties arose from this state of things, and on all these 
                           grounds I concluded that if the trade of <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Central <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span></span> 
                           could follow another route and reach the coast by sure 
                           roads on which no tribute would have to be paid, and 
                           where no difficulties were to be apprhended, everybody 
                           would be the gainer. After what I have seea at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Banana</span> 
                           and <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Boma</span> I believe I am not mistaken, and that traders 
                           like myself can only gain by dispatching their produce 
                           from <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Nyangoué</span> by way of the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Falls</span> and the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Congo</span>."

                     <br><p class="p  ">During the two days' stay made by Mr. Stanley's 
                        expedition at this place, in order to organize the caravan 
                        inteaded to proceed by way of the Falls to Leopoldville, 
                        a resident here had a conversation with Tippoo Tib, in 
                        which the latter entered into full particulars concerning 
                        his past and present connexion with Mr. H. M. Stanley.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">It was at Zanzibar, where Tippoo Tib, aocompanied by 
                        his son, had gone to sell ivory, that he received Mr. 
                        Stanley's letter from Brussels, proposing to him to enter 
                        the service of the Assooiation. No mention was then 
                        made of any appointment as Governor of the Falls, it 
                        being merely stated that Tippoo Tib's services would be 
                        used on the Upper Congo, as near as possible to the centre 
                        of his operations in Africa. Tippoo Tib mentioned these 
                        proposals to his son, who advised him not to accept them 
                        He resolved to await Mr. Stanley's arrival, offering his 
                        services meanwhile for engaging 200 Zanzibar natives for 
                        the projected expedition.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">After speaking of the services which he had rendered to 
                        Lieutenant Cameron and Mr Stanley, and particularly to 
                        the latter on his first expedition, Tippoo Tib was asked what 
                        had decided him to aceept Mr. Stanley's offer and to ac-
                        company him to Boma. He replied as follows :—
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"I never clearly understood the object or the 
                        organization of the International African Association. The other 
                        Arab chiefs and myself at first believed, on seeing 
                        expeditions organized at Zanzibar under Captain Cambier and 
                        Lieutenant Becker, that the Europeans wished to compete 
                        with us in the markets of Tabora and Zanzibar, and 
                        export, like ourselves, ivory and produce of varibus kinds.
                        We did not know whether Stanley and the other white 
                        chiefs were acting for the King of the Belgians, for
                        Belgium, or for the International Association, and we 
                        were always left in doubt on the point.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"But now that we have seen that such are not the 
                        intentions of the whites-that is to say, of the Belgians 
                        and English, whom we have met on the East Coast ; now 
                        that they have abandoned this part of Africa in order to 
                        establish, by common accord, we are told, between all the 
                        great peoples of Europe, a State where everybody may 
                        freely trade, we see no further reason to doubt the good
                        intentions of the whites, who have already done so much
                        in Africa."
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Being next asked if there were not other reasons which 
                        had led him to accept Mr. Stanley's proposals, Tippoo 
                        Tib replied :—
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"Yes. I confess that at first the idea of becoming a 
                        functionary of the Independent Congo State was a singular 
                        one to me. But Stanley pointed out that I should have a 
                        privileged position; that the State on its side could only 
                        gain by seeing its establishments on the Upper Congo 
                        supported by the authority which for many years past I 
                        had acquired over the people of the interior, who all knew 
                        me through having traded with me ; while,as regarded 
                        myself, I could not but strengthen my commercial relations 
                        by means of the support which the Congo State would 
                        afford to me, as to all who were established on its 
                        territory.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"I perceived the justice of these arguments, and I had, 
                        moreover, at heart to remedy, as far as I could, the 
                        mischief which the Arabs and the population at the Falls 
                        had done in destroying the station at Stanley Fal1s. This 
                        act was the result of misunderstanding and imprudence; but 
                        I do not think that I can refuse to make reparation if, as 
                        I believe, I can do so."
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Tippoo Tib admitted that he was also influenced by 
                        commercial considerations of another kind, and said ,—
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"The circumstances under which trade is carried on 
                        with the East coast are no longer so favourable as some 
                        years back, when I commenced trading with Zanzibar and 
                        abroad. Trade at that period had, so to speak, no 
                        existence. I established myself at Houron, near Tabora, 
                        with my old father and my brother Mohamed Massoudi, 
                        wishing first to create in the neigbbourhood plantations 
                        yielding satisfactory returns, and above all to monopolize 
                        the ivory trade by establishing Arab correspondents 
                        throughout Central Africa, on the shores of the Lakes, 
                        and as far Nyangoué. The people of the centre, who 
                        had no means of disposing of their considerable stocks of 
                        ivory, let me have them at a price which enabled me to 
                        realize a large profit. In a short time I had monopolized 
                        nearly all the sources of ivory production, 
                        and all the trade of the Manyems was in my hands.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"The great difficulty has always been to bring the 
                        produce of Central Africa to the markets of Tabera and 
                        Zanzibar. At first this was easy enough, but gradually 
                        the people of the centre became aware that they could
                        also gain something by my operations, and commenced 
                        imposing heavy tribute upon me for right of way through 
                        their territories. For instanoe, the Wa-Kundis, who 
                        alone possess the boats necessary for crossing the 
                        Malagarazi, exact exorbitant terms for the use of them. 
                        Certain tribes sometimes attacked my caravans, causing 
                        me heavy loss in men and merchandise.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"Even on the coast the conditions of trade changed. 
                        The Germans were everywhere, and their pretentions 
                        rendered business more and more difficult. Great 
                        difficulties arose from this state of things, and on all these 
                        grounds I concluded that if the trade of Central Africa 
                        could follow another route and reach the coast by sure 
                        roads on which no tribute would have to be paid, and 
                        where no difficulties were to be apprhended, everybody 
                        would be the gainer. After what I have seea at Banana 
                        and Boma I believe I am not mistaken, and that traders 
                        like myself can only gain by dispatching their produce 
                        from Nyangoue by way of the Falls and the Congo."
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">On being asked what he would do on reaching the Falls,
                        and how he would fulfil his mission, Tippoo Tib 
                        replied :—
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"In the first place I feel sure that Stanley will succeed 
                        in his enterprise and relieve Emin Pasha. He is a real 
                        Arab for energy and intelligence. I do not know yet for 
                        certain whether I shall go with him as far as Wadelai, but 
                        I think I shall. Once installed at the Falls, I shall rebuild 
                        the stations and summon all the Arab and native chiefs to 
                        a great meeting, at which I shall announce to them my nomination 
                        as Governor, and my intentions. They will 
                        be surprised, I expect, to see me arrive from this side, for 
                        the news of my leaving Zanzibar with Stanley and of my 
                        nomination as Governor cannot reach Nyangoue and 
                        Central Africa in less than four or five months, and I shall 
                        arrive at the Falls before that time. When order is 
                        reestablished at the Falls, I shall probably undertake a 
                        commercial expedition to nyangoue and the Lake
                        region."

                     <p class="p  ">The Arab chief's real name is Hamed-ben-Hamed, the 
                        <span class="italic ">sobriquet</span> of Tippoo Tib having been given to him owing to 
                        a twitching of the eyelids to which he is subject. The 
                        best understanding exists between Mr. Stanley and Tippoo 
                        Tib, and the latter has already been of great assistance in 
                        maintaining order among the Zanzibar men. Son of an 
                        Arab of Zanzbiar, Tippoo Tib detests negroes, and is 
                        attached to the whites, whom, in conversation, he calls his 
                        European brothers.

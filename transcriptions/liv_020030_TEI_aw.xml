<p>My friend <persName>Tom Moody</persName> was a very fair sample of that class which is 
now-a-days called the old time <orgName>Plantocracy</orgName>. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Tom</persName> had his faults as 
well as many a worse man, but if his failings were many, his virtues 
were not less numerous. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Hospitable almost to extravagance was <persName>Tom</persName> 
and as charitable a soul as ever breathed the breath of Heaven. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>He 
was honorable too, strictly honorable in his dealings with the world; 
but Heaven help the poor devil who might have been discovered in an 
endeavour to deceive him. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Tom</persName> had no mercy for such rascally 
de<!-- ­ -->linquents, as he termed them; and if they happened to be persons 
over whom he had any control&#8212;his slaves for instance&#8212;he would flog 
them to within an inch of their lives. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Not that Tom was fond of 
using the cat&#8212;that terrific foe to <persName>Quashie</persName>'s peace of mind and corporeal 
comfort&#8212;on the contrary, I never knew a planter who took less 
ad<!-- ­ -->vantage of his power over his human cattle than did <persName>Tom</persName>&#8212;but he 
administered the castigation by way of medicine as he said&#8212;and the 
stronger the dose the better for the patient. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>"'Tis all for his good, 
the <hi rend="italic">nagur</hi>," he once observed to me, on his return from witnessing the                        
punishment of one of his people. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>"It's all for his good, poor 
<persName>Pompey</persName>. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>If I let him alone he would rob every cane off the property 
and damn his soul to eternity. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>So you see, <persName>Joe</persName>, my boy, I'm only 
endeavouring to rescue his soul from the clutches of his cousin, the 
devil; but I dare say the scoundrel hasn't a piece of gratitude to give 
me in return for my kindness. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>"</p>
<p>It was about this period, during a rather lengthy sojourn at 
"<placeName>Moody's Hill</placeName>," that the following circumstances came under my 
ob<!-- - -->servation. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Tom</persName> had a favorite slave, a good-looking, glossy-skinned 
negro&#8212;called <persName>Lycurgus</persName>; but notwithstanding <persName>Tom</persName>'s partiality for the
       
	<pb facs="liv_020030_0002" n="0002"/>
<fw><seg rend="center caps">Or the Old Time Busha. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/></seg> <seg rend="right">31</seg></fw>
fellow and <persName>Curgy</persName>'s apparent affection for his master, the latter had of 
late begun to entertain some suspicion of <persName>Curgy</persName>'s fidelity. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Tom</persName>'s 
mind was rather prejudiced against bun by another slave of his, whose 
petty tattling, like a <term type="insect">great horse fly</term>, kept constantly buzzing about 
the ears of his master, much to the injury of <persName>Curgy</persName> who was entirely 
ignorant of all that was going forward to his prejudice.</p>

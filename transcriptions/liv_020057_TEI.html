                              these 
                              fugitives, some 20 miles away, to see them for myself.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">At N * found large town of K *, and scattered through it many small settlements of
                              L * 
                              refugees. The town of N * consists approximately of seventy-one K * houses, and seventy-three
                              
                              occupied by L *. These latter seemed industrious, simple folk, many weaving palm fibre
                              into 
                              mats or native cloth; others had smithies, working brass wire into bracelets, chains,
                              and anklets; 
                              some iron-workers making knives. Sitting down in one of these blacksmith’s sheds,
                              the five men 
                              at work ceased and came over to talk to us. I counted ten women, six grown-up men,
                              and eight 
                              lads and women in this one shed of L *. I then asked them to tell me why they had
                              left their 
                              homes. Three of the men sat down in front of me, and told a tale which I cannot think
                              can be true, 
                              but it seemed to come straight from their hearts. I repeatedly asked certain parts
                              to be 
                              gone over again while I wrote in my note-book. The fact of my writing down and asking

                              the women. Sometimes the soldiers finding him thus refused to believe what he said,
                              and killed 
                              him for shirking his work. This often happens.”

                              to you personally a lot of evidence as to the terrible maladministration practised
                              in the past in 
                              the district. I saw the official at the post of E E*. He is the successor of the infamous
                              wretch 
                              D E, of whom you heard so much yourself from the refugees at N*. This D E was in this
                              dis- 
                              trict in ..., ..., and ..., and he it was that depopulated the country. His successor,
                              M N, is 
                              very vehement in his denunciations of him, and declares that he will leave nothing
                              undone that 
                              he can do to bring him to justice. He is now stationed at G G*, near our station at
                              H H*. 
                              Of M N I have nothing to say but praise. In a very difficult position he has done
                              wonderfully. 
                              The people are beginning to show themselves and gathering about the many posts under
                              his 
                              charge. M N told me that when he took over the station at E E* from D E he visited
                              the prison, 
                              and almost fainted, so horrible was the condition of the place and the poor wretches
                              in it. He 
                              told me of many things he had heard of from the soldiers. Of D E shooting with his
                              own hand 
                              man after man who had come with an insufficient quantity of rubber. Of his putting
                              several one 
                              behind the other and shooting them all with one cartridge. Those who accompanied me,
                              
                              also heard from the soldiers many frightful stories and abundant confirmation of what
                              was told us 
                              at N* about the taking to D E of the organs of the men slain by the sentries of the
                              various posts. 
                              I saw a letter from the present officer at F F* to M N, in which he upbraids him for
                              not using 
                              more vigorous means, telling him to talk less and shoot more, and reprimanding him
                              for not 
                              killing more than one in a district under his care where there was a little trouble.
                              M N is due in 
                              Belgium in about three months, and says he will land one day and begin denouncing
                              his prede- 
                              cessor the next. I received many favours from him, and should be sorry to injure him
                              in any 
                              way..... He has already accepted a position in one of the Companies, being unable
                              to 
                              continue longer in the service of the State. I have never seen in all the different
                              parts of the 
                              State which I have visited a neater station, or a district more under control than
                              that over 
                              which this M N presides. He is the M N the people of N* told us of, who they said
                              was kind.

                              and would be willing to go with me; so, after procuring some necessary articles in
                              the 
                              shape of provisions and barter, I started from our post at N*. It was the end of the
                              
                              dry season, and many of the water-courses were quite dry, and during some days we
                              
                              even found the lack of water somewhat trying. The first two days’ travelling was 
                              through alternating forest and grass plain, our guides, as far as possible, avoiding
                              the 
                              villages..... Getting fresh guides from a little village, we got into a region almost
                              
                              entirely forested, and later descended into a gloomy valley still dripping from the
                              rain. 
                              According to our guides we should soon be through this, but it was not until the afternoon
                              of the 
                              second day after entering that we once more emerged from the gloom. Several times
                              we lost 
                              the track, and I had little inclination to blame the guides, for several times the
                              undergrowth and 
                              a species of thorn palm were trodden down in all directions by the elephants. It would
                              seem to 
                              be a favourite hunting ground of theirs, and once we got very close to a large herd
                              who went off 
                              at a furious pace, smashing down the small trees, trumpeting, and making altogether
                              a most 
                              terrifying noise. The second night in this forest we came across, when looking for
                              the track, a 
                              little village of runaways from the rubber district. When assured of our friendliness
                              they took 
                              us in and gave us what shelter they could. During the night another tornado swept
                              the country 
                              and blew down a rotten tree, some branches of which fell in amongst my tent and the
                              little huts 
                              in which some of the boys were sleeping. It was another most narrow escape.

                              run away, or have been killed or died of starvation, and so there is no one to get

                              passing through several other large depopulated districts. On all sides were signs
                              of a very recent 
                              large population, but all was as quiet as death, and buffaloes roamed at will amongst
                              the still growing 
                              manioc and bananas. It was a sad day, and when, as the sun was setting, we came upon

                              service, and houses for all the party; but we had not been long there before we found
                              that we 
                              had reached the centre of what was once a very thickly populated region, known as
                              C C*, from 
                              which many refugees in the neighbourhood of G* had come. It was here a white man,
                              
                              known by the name of D E, lived..... He came to the district, and, after seven months
                              
                              of diabolical work, left it a waste. Some of the stories current about him are not
                              fit to record 
                              here, but the native evidence is so consistent and so universal that it is difficult
                              to disbelieve 
                              that murder and rapine on a large scale were carried on here. His successor, a man
                              of a different 
                              nature, and much liked by the people, after more than two and a-half years has succeeded
                              in 
                              winning back to the side of the State post a few natives, and there I saw them in

                              whose coming among them had set them all a-wondering. From this there was no 
                              fear of losing the track. For many miles it was a broad road, from 6 to 10 feet in
                              width,

                              great facility with which we could continue our journey, we could not help picturing
                              the many 
                              cruel scenes which, in all probability, were a constant accompaniment to the laying
                              of these huge 
                              logs. I wish to emphasize as much as possible the desolation and emptiness of the
                              country we 
                              passed through. That it was only very recently a well-populated country, and, as things
                              go out 
                              here, rather more densely than usual, was very evident. After a few hours we came
                              to a State 
                              rubber post. In nearly every instance these posts are most imposing, some of them
                              giving rise to 
                              the supposition that several white men were residing in them. But in only one did
                              we find a 
                              white man—the successor of D E. At one place I saw lying about in the grass surrounding
                              
                              the post, which is built on the site of several very large towns, human bones, skulls,
                              and, in 
                              some places, complete skeletons. On inquiring the reason for this unusual sight: ‘Oh!’
                              said 
                              my informant, ‘When the bambote (soldiers) were sent to make us cut rubber there were
                              so many 
                              killed we got tired of burying, and sometimes when we wanted to bury we were not allowed
                              to.’

                           <p class="p  ">“‘Oh! sometimes we were ordered to go, and the sentry would find us preparing food

                              eat while in the forest, and he would shoot two or three to hurry us along. Sometimes
                              we would 
                              try and do a little work on our plantations, so that when the harvest time came we
                              should have 
                              something to eat, and the sentry would shoot some of us to teach us that our business
                              was not to 
                              plant but to get rubber. Sometimes we were driven off to live for a fortnight in the
                              forest 
                              without any food and without anything to make a fire with, and many died of cold and
                              hunger. 
                              Sometimes the quantity brought was not sufficient, and then several would be killed
                              to frighten 
                              us to bring more. Some tried to run away, and died of hunger and privation in the
                              forest in 
                              trying to avoid the State posts.’

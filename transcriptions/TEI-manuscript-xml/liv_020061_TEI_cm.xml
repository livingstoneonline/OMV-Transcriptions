				<p><lb>In <date>February, 1872</date> I was at <placeName>Sharaupur School</placeName></lb> 
					<lb>near <settlement>Nasick</settlement>. I heard <persName>Mr. Price</persName> talk of an expedition going</lb>  
					<lb>to <country>Africa</country> to find out <persName>Dr. Livingstone</persName>. I and many others were</lb> 
					<lb>willing to go and join the expedition. Some time after the </lb> 
					<lb><persName>Rev. W. S. Price</persName> received a telegram. Whether it was from</lb>  
					<lb><settlement>London</settlement> or <settlement>Bombay</settlement> I cannot tell; but this I know, that I,</lb> 
					<lb><persName>Jacob Wainwright</persName>, and four others were chosen for the <w>ex</lb> 
					<lb>pedition</w>. We were ordered immediately to leave <settlement>Nasick</settlement></lb> 
					<lb>for <settlement>Bombay</settlement>. At <settlement>Bombay</settlement> the <persName>Rev. J. S. S. Robertson</persName>, the <w>Secre</lb> 
					<lb>tary</w>, got us all the necessary things for our journey from</lb>  
					<lb><settlement>Bombay</settlement> to <region>Zanzibar</region>. Having got ready, I and my fellow</lb> 
					<lb>companions left <settlement>Bombay</settlement> per ship <term>"Livinia,"</term> bound for</lb> 
					<lb><region>Zanzibar</region>. The captain of the ship was very kind to us through</lb> 
					<lb>out the voyage. We had pleasant wind which made our</lb>  
					<lb>ship to glide rapidly over the mighty foaming ocean. But</lb>  
					<lb>it did not continue so for many days. One day a heavy</lb>  
					<lb>storm made our little ship to reel fearfully, so much</lb>  
					<lb>so that we and other passengers on board had entirely</lb>  
					<lb>despaired of our lives. But God in whose hands the powers</lb>  
					<lb>of the sea are, was with us. The raging of the water soon</lb>  
					<lb>ceased and our hearts began again to look on the blue</lb>  
					<lb>sea with less fear. After sailing twenty-one days we</lb>  
					<lb>landed at <region>Zanzibar</region>. We anchored about half past 6 p.m.</lb> 
					<lb>Next day very early in the morning the captain of our ship</lb> 
					<lb>took me and my companions to the <term>English Consul</term>, <persName>Dr. Kirk</persName>.</lb> 
					<lb>He was very kind to us and he got us a room where we</lb> 
					<lb>lived in waiting for the remainder <add>of the expedition</add>.</lb> 
					<lb>We were only four days in the island when the remainder of the expedition</lb> 
					<lb>consisting of <persName>young Livingstone</persName>, <persName>Mr. Dawson</persName> and others arrived</lb> 
					<lb>from <country>England</country>. After their arrival everything was got ready.</lb> 
liv_020061_0002
					<lb>The <term>Livingstone Search Expedition</term> then left the <w>is-</lb>
					<lb>land</w> of <region>Zanzibar</region> for <settlement>Bagamoyo</settlement>. At <settlement>Bagamoyo</settlement> while</lb> 
				<lb>we were ready for leaving the country for the interior, <persName>Mr.</lb> 
				<lb>H. M. Stanley</persName> at once made his appearance at <settlement>Baga</lb>
				<lb>moyo</settlement> from the interior, bringing the news of <persName>Dr. L</persName>. being</lb>
				<lb>found. We were all glad to hear that the good <persName>Dr.</persName> was</lb> 
				<lb>alive. We all then returned to <region>Zanzibar</region> again with <persName>Mr.</lb>
				<lb>Stanley</persName> leaving some of us behind to take care of some</lb>
				<lb>of the baggages that were left behind. At <region>Zanzibar</region> the</lb>
					<lb><term>Europeans</term> were all very glad to see <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>, specially the</lb> 
				<lb><persName>young Livingstone</persName>. About ten days were given to the men</lb> 
				<lb>who came from the interior with <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName> for <w>refresh</lb>
					<lb>ment</w>, after which time they were again asked to go and</lb> 
				<lb>carry some stores for the <persName>Dr. L.</persName> sent by <persName>Mr. Stanley</persName>. <persName>Young</lb> 
															<lb>Mr. Livingstone</persName> was willing to join this caravan in order</lb>
					<lb>to go and see his beloved father. But the <term>European</term> friends</lb>
				<lb>at <region>Zanzibar</region> would not permit him to go. He asked me</lb> 
				<lb>and my companions whether we would prefer going to <country>India</country></lb> 
				<lb>back or joining the party that was ready for going to carry</lb>
				<lb>some stores for his father. We all preferred going to see the</lb> 
				<lb><persName>Dr.</persName> in the heart of <bloc>Africa</bloc> which was one object in leaving</lb> 
				<lb><country>India</country>. The whole party consisted of 70 persons in all. We</lb> 
				<lb>then left <region>Zanzibar</region> for <settlement>Bagamoyo</settlement> again. At <settlement>Bagamoyo</settlement></lb> 
																							<lb>we did not stay long for we remained there only two days</lb>
																							<lb>and then commenced our long journey to <country>Unyembe</country> in the interior.</lb>
																							<lb>In about 2 months and a half we reached <country>Uniembe</country>. Here we</lb> 
				<lb>found the great missionary and enterprising traveller, living</lb> 
					<lb>with savage <term>Africans</term> and half barbarous <term>Arabs</term>. The <persName>Dr.</persName> was</lb> 
					<lb>very pleased to see us a little band of <term>Christians</term>. Many and if</lb> 
				<lb>not all of the nine boys who joined him at first in his long</lb> 
				<lb>and adventurous travels had entirely deserted him. It was</lb> 
				<lb>therefore natural for him to ask us whether we preferred</lb> 
				<lb>going back to the coast or following him in his adventurous</lb>

liv_020061_0003
				<lb>work. He was afraid we would prove ourselves the same</lb> 
				<lb>as our brothers. He therefore gave us a day for consideration as</lb>
				<lb>to whether we would go and be faithful to him in all the trials</lb> 
				<lb>and enormous difficulties and countless privations while journey</lb>
				<lb>ing about through countries unknown to finish his work assigned</lb> 
				<lb>to him or make our way to the coast again. Some of us were willing</lb> 
				<lb>to return to the coast a thing which would go very much against us</lb> 
				<lb>had we left him. After a little consultation we all made up our</lb> 
				<lb>minds to follow him. Ten days were then given us here at <country>Uniembe</country></lb> 
				<lb>for taking rest. When the ten days were expired we left the</lb>
				<lb><country>Uniembe</country> country for <country>Cawende</country>. In this country there is the <geogName>lake</lb> 
					<lb>Tanganyika</geogName>. We then commenced our journey by coasting the lake</lb> 
				<lb>towards the north east till we reached the country of the <w><country>Nama</lb>
					<lb>roongoo</country></w>. Leaving the country of the <country>Namaroongoo</country> we entered</lb> 
				<lb>the country of the <country>Wapipa</country>. But before leaving the frontiers</lb> 
				<lb>of the fierce race of the <country>Namaroongoo</country> for <country>Pipa</country>, the <persName>Dr<persName>. was</lb>
						<lb>asked to give something to the chiefs of the country as he was quitting</lb> 
						<lb>their land. The <persName>Dr.<persName> instead of heeding to their everlasting demands</lb> 
							<lb>ordered the men to take up their loads and move onwards</lb> 
							<lb>without giving them anything: After marches and countermarches</lb> 
							<lb>of many a long day we entered the <country>Wemba</country> country. Here we</lb> 
					<lb>with great difficulties arising from want of food. The <term>natives</term></lb> 
							<lb>had deserted their country owing to some petty wars and our</lb> 
							<lb>whole expedition was thrown to the severest test as we lay for</lb> 
							<lb>days without any means of sustenance. We fed upon wild fruit</lb> 
							<lb>of the jungle. The <persName>Dr.</persName> then despatched ten men full armed to go</lb> 
							<lb>finding if any trace of a road leading into countries or</lb> 
							<lb>villages could be found while the whole of the expedition</lb> 
							<lb>and the <persName>Dr.</persName> remained behind. The ten men travelled 3 days</lb> 
							<lb>after which they found villages. The news of our arrival soon</lb>
					<lb>reached <persName>Kumbakumba</persName> an enterprising Arab chief and one</lb>
							<lb>of the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> friend, who hearing of his coming sent him some</lb> 

liv_020061_0004
					<lb>rice, goats, etc. <persName>Kumbakumba</persName></persName> is an Arab chief and is a terror</lb>
					<lb>of that part of the country. After remaining a few days at <country>Wemba</country></lb> 
						<lb>we left it for the island where the king <persName>Matipa</persName> lives in the midst</lb> 
					<lb>of the large sheet of water called <geogName>Bemba</geogName>. We found the king</lb> 
					<lb>in the middle of <geogName>Bemba Lake</geogName>. We reached him by going in</lb> 
									<lb>small native canoes. The Lake has many islands in it and it</lb> 
										<lb>took us <add>two</add> days to row to go to the island where the king resides. We</lb>
											<lb>were detained for a long time by the king in this island as he was</lb> 
												<lb>not willing to give us canoes. At last the <persName>Dr.</persName> ordered all his</lb>
													<lb>men to arm themselves andd to follow him to the king's hut to </lb>
														<lb>demand boats. After telling the king the folly of his keeping us</lb> 
															<lb>longer against our will we demanded to leave the place soon any</lb>
																<lb>how contrary to his will. The king seeing that the <persName>Dr.</persName> was determined</lb>
																	<lb>to leave he immediately procured him many boats which soon</lb> 
																		<lb>transported the <persName>Dr.</persName>, his men, and their baggages on the other side</lb> 
					<lb>of the <country>Bisa</country> country. It took us 3 days to cross the <geogName>Bemba</geogName></lb> 
																				<lb>lake to get to other side of <country>Bisa</country> country. When we got to the other</lb> 
																					<lb>side of the <country>Bisa</country>, the <persName>Dr.</persName> divided his men into two divisions.</lb>
																						<lb>One division went with the <persName>Dr.</persName> coasting one of the rivers called</lb>
					<lb><geogName>Chambesi</geogName> which falls into the <geogName>Bemba Lake</geogName>. But he had</lb>
					<lb>soon to leave following <geogName>Chambesi</geogName> and went coasting</lb>
																									<lb>another river the name of which I do not now remember.</lb>
																										<lb>The second division went on by land following the same</lb> 
					<lb>direction from where the <geogName>Chambesi</geogName> flowed. We travelled</lb>
																												<lb>three days without meeting the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> party. We then halted</lb> 
					<lb>three days near a river which the <term>natives</term> of the country would</lb> 
																														<lb>not allow us to cross it owing to the war that was going on</lb> 
																															<lb>in that part of the country. The <persName>Dr.</persName> while coasting the river</lb> 
																																<lb>in canoes took sickness. He then sent some of his men</lb> 
																																	<lb>to find out where the second division was, in order to get</lb> 
																																		<lb>the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> donkey from them for him to ride as he was ill</lb> 
																																			<lb>with dysentery which sickness added to the inclement clime</lb>
																																				<lb>and the need of medical man did greatly weaken his <w>con-</lb>
					<lb>stitution</w>. He then soon came and joined with the second</lb>
																																						<lb>division. The next day we all along with the <persName>Dr.</persName> crossed</lb>
liv_020061_0005
				<lb>river where the natives detained the first division.</lb>
				<lb>The <persName>Dr.</persName> then began to grow worse and worse every day. He was</lb> 
				<lb>no longer able to ride on his donkey, and yet, strange to say,</lb> 
				<lb>he urged us all forward though we did not know where we</lb> 
				<lb>were hastening to. But each and all of us plaining saw</lb> 
				<lb>that our master was declining every day by the fatigue of the</lb> 
				<lb>journey and by the sickness. When he could no longer ride or</lb> 
				<lb>be able to sit on his donkey we then carried him on a cot.</lb>
				<lb>But time soon came when we could no longer also carry him</lb>
					<lb>about in the open heat of the sun of <region>central Africa</region>. We <w>there-</lb>
					<lb>fore</w> halted at a place called <settlement>Kalonga Njofu</settlement> on the frontiers</lb>
					<lb>of the <country>Bisa</country> country where we remained five days. Leaving</lb>
					<lb>this place we crossed a river which divides the <country>Bisa</country> country</lb>
					<lb>and <country>Illala</country>. In <country>Illala</country> we raised a booth for the sick</lb> 
				<lb><persName>Dr.</persName> His sickness increased every day which thing greatly alarmed</lb> 
					<lb>us. We six <settlement>Nassik</settlement> felt more fear as we were the only <term>xtians</term></lb>
					<lb>while the majority were <term>mohammedans</term>. We thought if our</lb> 
				<lb>master die in this part of the world surely none of us</lb> 
					<lb>that are <term>Christians</term> would survive to go and tell the story</lb> 
				<lb>of our master's death. But our God overruled the whole</lb> 
				<lb>affair as it pleased him. <persName>Majuàra</persName> was his waiting</lb> 
				<lb>boy in the booth. On the morning of the second day of our</lb> 
					<lb>arrival at <country>Illala</country>, <persName>Majuàra</persName> who always slept near our</lb> 
				<lb>sick master, was compelled by necessity to leave the booth</lb> 
				<lb>for some minutes leaving the <persName>Dr.</persName> on the cot in side the</lb> 
				<lb>booth. But on his return again he found the <persName>Dr.</persName> fallen</lb> 
				<lb>on the ground already expired. This took place on the <date>4th May</lb> 
					<lb>1873</date>. We were all as it may easily be seen then described</lb> 
				<lb>very sorry for our master. The whole camp wept for him.</lb> 
				<lb>We decided that our master's death should be kept a secret</lb> 
					<lb>from the <term>natives</term>. But the king of <country>Illala</country> soon heard</lb> 
				<lb>the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> death on the second day. He was grieved for not</lb> 
				<lb>having been informed by us at once of the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> death.</lb> 
				<lb>To show how much loved the <persName>Dr.</persName> was he summoned all</lb> 
				<lb>the chiefs, men, and women of his country to come out</lb>

liv_020061_0006
				<lb>with their drums and other materials of war to morn for</lb> 
				<lb>the <persName>Dr.</persName> after their custom. Accordingly his orders were obeyed.</lb> 
				<lb>There was then the most devilish and fanatical morning</lb> 
				<lb>dance in which men, women and children promiscuously</lb> 
				<lb>mingled. The whole caravan knowing the great loss they</lb> 
				<lb>had sustained fired incessantly their guns in honour of</lb> 
				<lb>their master. The morning was kept up for two days. Three</lb> 
				<lb>days after, the bereaved faithfuls of the great traveller</lb> 
				<lb>held a council as to what should be done to the body of</lb>
				<lb>their deceased commander. After each giving his own</lb> 
				<lb>private opinion it was unanimously carried out that</lb> 
				<lb>the body of our master should not be left in the <w>in-</lb>
					<lb>terior</w> of <bloc>Africa</bloc> but embalm it and carry it to the</lb> 
					<lb>coast. Accordingly, I and another <term>Swahili</term> man dissected</lb>
				<lb>the body and after removing all the abdominal parts</lb> 
				<lb>filled it with salt and brandy and then exposed it to</lb> 
				<lb>the sun fifteen days. We then began to think of return</lb>
				<lb>ing to the coast with our master's remains. There is a large</lb> 
					<lb>tree at <country>Illala</country> and if travellers are ever to reach that</lb> 
				<lb>part of <bloc>Africa</bloc> they will not fail to see the <w>inscrip-</lb>
					<lb>tions</w> made on it. The name of the famous traveller</lb> 
				<lb>is there nicely cut on the tree and the date of his</lb> 
				<lb>death. Thus far did I and my companions go with</lb> 
					<lb><persName>Dr. L</persName>. whom death refused us to bring him alive again.</lb>
					<lb>We then soon left <country>Illala</country> and travelling westward</lb> 
					<lb>after three days we came to the river <geogName>Luapulla</lb> 
				<lb>which we crossed.</lb></p>
				<lb><p>After crossing the <geogName>Luàpulla</geogName> we entered the country</lb> 
				<lb>of <country>Cawende</country>. Leaving <country>Cawende</country> we entered the country</lb> 
				<lb>of <country>Wemba</country>. Here we met our formerly road which we</lb> 
				<lb>followed and led us to the country of the <persName>King Kapesa</persName></lb> 
				<lb>one of the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> best friends. <persName>King Kapesa</persName> when told</lb> 
				<lb>of the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> death, he sighed heavily for him and also</lb> 
				<lb>appeared to be very sorry for him. We then left the</lb> 
				<lb><country>Wemba</country> country and travelling every day about a</lb> 
				<lb>score of miles we came to a country called <country>Pipa</country>.</lb></p> 

liv_020061_0007
				<lb>There was no occasion for losing time now. Leaving the</lb> 
				<lb><country>Pipa</country> country we followed the same course we took <w>go-</lb>
				<lb>ing</w> time that is coasting the <geogName>lake Tanganyika</geogName>. Visiting the</lb> 
				<lb><country>Pipa</country> country we entered <country>Namaroongoo</country> country. Leaving</lb> 
				<lb><country>Namaroongoo</country> country we hastily passed the <country>Cawende</country> </lb>
				<lb>and <country>Conongo</country> countries and finally arrived at <w><country>Uriem-</lb>
				<lb>be</country></w> country. Here we met three <term>Europeans</term>, to wit, <persName>Mr.</lb> 
				<lb>Cameron</persName>, <persName>Dr. Dillon</persName> and <persName>Mr. Moffatt</persName>. They were <w>proceed-</lb>
				<lb>ing</w> to <settlement>Ujiji</settlement> with a view of reserving some remaining</lb>
				<lb>papers left there by the <persName>Dr. L</persName>. But as they saw the <w>re-</lb>
				<lb>mains</w> of the <persName>Dr.</persName> with us, two of them <persName>Dr. Dillon</persName> and</lb> 
				<lb><persName>Mr. Moffatt</persName> changed their minds so that instead<del>ing</del> of</lb> 
				<lb>proceeding on their journey they preferred returning</lb> 
				<lb>with us to the coast. We were one month at <country>Uniembe</country></lb>
				<lb>with the three gentlemen. On the day of our leaving</lb> 
				<lb><country>Uniembe</country>, <persName>Mr. Cameron</persName> also left it for <country>Ujiji</country> while <persName>Mr.</lb> 
				<lb>Moffatt</persName> and <persName>Dr. Dillon</persName> joined us. <persName>Dr. Dillon</persName>, however,</lb> 
				<lb>soon took sickness on the way. After journeying three</lb> 
				<lb>days from <country>Uniembe</country> <persName>Dr. D</persName>. blew up his own brains</lb> 
				<lb>with a gun and instantly expired. We buried him</lb> 
				<lb>in the same country where he died.</p></lb>

				<lb><p>Leaving <country>Uniembe</country> we came to a country called <country>Ugogo</country>.</lb> 
				<lb>Hitherto the <persName>Dr.'s</persName> remains was carried on the shoulders</lb> 
				<lb>of two persons throughout, but coming to the <country>Ugogo</country></lb>
				<lb>country for fear of the <term>natives</term> knowing that we were <w>carry</lb>
				<lb>ing</w> dead body it became necessary to make it single man's</lb> 
				<lb>load. It is an abomination thing among some of the African</lb>
				<lb>tribes to carry a dead body through their country. The <term>Wagogo</term></lb> 
				<lb>are a fierce and warlike race and we were afraid</lb> 
				<lb>in passing their country the remains of our master </lb>
				<lb>would fall into their hands. But we soon passed</lb> 
				<lb>their country and entered the <country>Usagara</country> country. Rapidly</lb> 
				<lb>passing through the <country>Usagara</country> country we entered the</lb> 
				<lb><country>Usigua</country>. Leaving <country>Usigua</country> we rapidly moved on till we</lb> 
				<lb>once more again saw <settlement>Buàgamoyo</settlement> <foreign>"heria bahari"</foreign> or</lb> 
				<lb>welcome sea, was the cheering word heard from <w>every</lb>

				<lb>body's</w> lips while approaching <settlement>Buagamoyo</settlement>.</p></lb>
				<lb><p>At <settlement>Buagamoyo</settlement> there is a <term>French Roman Catholic mission</term></lb> 
				<lb>and as soon as we arrived <persName>Mr. Moffatt</persName> took the body to</lb> 
				<lb>the mission house where a coffin was made for it.</lb></p>

				<lb><p>On the following day <persName>Mr. Moffatt</persName> took the body on board</lb> 
				<lb>a ship which soon weighed anchor and left for <region>Zanzibar</region></lb> 
				<lb>leaving many of us behind. But as the end of our journey</lb>
				<lb>was not ended there was no reason for us to remain</lb> 
				<lb>long at <settlement>Buagamoyo</settlement>; hence remaining only there we</lb> 
				<lb>left it also for <region>Zanzibar</region>. We raised our grateful thanks</lb> 
				<lb>to our heavenly father for his goodness in bringing us safe</lb> 
				<lb>again thus far. We all went to the <term>English Consul</term>'s house.</lb> 
				<lb>Of the nine boys who followed the <persName>Dr.</persName> on the first out set</lb> 
				<lb>two only followed his remains to <region>Zanzibar</region>; to wit, <persName>Ed.</lb> 
				<lb>Gardiner</persName> and <persName>Nathaniel Cumba</persName>. These men throughout</lb> 
				<lb>the journey never associated with us six <term>Christian</term> boys</lb> 
				<lb>their brothers as they have turned out <term>mohammedans</term>.</lb> 
				<lb><persName>Chuma</persName> and <persName>Suse</persName>, in spite of all that the <persName>Dr.</persName> did for</lb> 
				<lb>them in getting them <term>English</term> education at <placeName><persName>Dr. Wilson's</persName> -</lb> 
				<lb>School</placeName> at <settlement>Bombay</settlement> have at last turned out <term>mohammedans</term></lb> 
				<lb>also. One of the nine boys, <persName>Simon Price</persName> by name, deserted</lb> 
				<lb>the <persName>Dr.</persName> long before his death and is now trading between</lb> 
				<lb>the coast and the interior. <persName>Abraham Pereira</persName> is at <country>Uniembe</country></lb> 
				<lb>he like <persName>Simon</persName> deserted their master. <persName>Andrew Powell</persName>, <persName>James</lb> 
				<lb>Brown</persName> and <persName>Albert</persName> we did not see them nor did we</lb> 
				<lb>get any satisfactory account of them. <persName>Richard Isenberg</persName></lb> 
				<lb>died soon before the <persName>Dr.</persName> left for the interior. <persName>Reuben</lb>
				<lb>Smith</persName> having fallen ill at <region>Zanzibar</region> was sent back</lb> 
				<lb>to <settlement>Bombay</settlement>. <persName>John Wainwright</persName>, one of our number was</lb> 
				<lb>lost on the way while returning to the coast along with us.</lb> 
				<lb>Having delivered the body at <region>Zanzibar</region> we remained there</lb> 
				<lb>a few days. The <term>English Consu</term>l paid five of us 87 1/2 dollars.</lb> 
				<lb>After a few days' stay the <term>English Consul</term> sent <persName>Jacob</lb>
				<lb>Wainwright</persName> to <country>England</country> while four of us he sent</lb> 
				<lb>to <settlement>Mombas</settlement>. At <settlement>Mombas</settlement> I not liking <persName>Mr. Sparshott's</persName></lb>

having a river frontage of not more than 2,000 metres, in area not
exceeding 400 hectares, which shall be leased to the Government
of the Soudan, to be administered and occupied as a commercial
station, so long as the Soudan is under the Anglo-Egyptian Government. 
It is agreed between the two High Contracting Parties
that the territory so leased shall not be used for any political or
military purpose.</p>

<p>The line from the junction of the Setit and Maieteb to the

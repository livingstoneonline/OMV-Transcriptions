                        which are suggested by what is being done under the sun of this day. I become so because
                        of the number of thoughts which spring up one by one involuntarily in my heart, all
                        of them great all of them wonderful, some of them of a painful, others of a pleasant,
                        nature. I feel perplexed as I look around me this day and see these white men our
                        Fathers, our Teachers, who think it no shame to speak of us as being "flesh of their
                        flesh and bone of their bone." On such a day as this I look above and beyond all these
                        petty differences and distinctions of caste and colour, and look upon the great and
                        noble work in which they have been engaged for us, and as I do so, these men rise
                        in my esteem and regard to a point of excellence and grandeur such as I never realised
                        before.

                        to honour, assembled as we are in such numbers, because to my mind although he has
                        long proclaimed aloud the word of his master, it is as if his voice this day sounded
                        in a louder and clearer tone.  Let us for a moment go back on the object of this day’s
                        gathering, let us take a retrospective view of our Father since his arrival amongst
                        us. What is it they say to us in this address which they present him? They say it
                        is fifty years since he left the land of his birth beyond the seas, since he left
                        his friends and closed the door of his home against himself, so that those earthly
                        endearments which are the support and the stay of a man’s life might never hinder
                        him in the work to which he had devoted himself.

                        saw it? Whither was he going? And what was it that allured him? In answer to these
                        questions, one great answer appears,—that the love of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
                        surpasses and transcends the knowledge of man, and the wisdom of man, and the judgment
                        of man, and the thoughts of man, and that there is nothing on earth to compare with
                        that love.

                        home—his character was not tainted so that he was compelled to leave his home to go
                        to an unknown country and amongst a nation that was not even of his own colour, there
                        to retrieve his character. He was actuated solely by the principle of love to Christ.
                        He was not actuated by the desire to share in the portioning out of the land of the
                        <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kaffir</span>, nor by the desire to share in the spoils of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kaffir</span> wars.

                        a very emphatic answer to this question. There are those who say that nothing has

                     <p class="p  ">God is not a fool like man. He knows the end of a thing from the beginning. If his
                        eternal purpose of man’s salvation were destined to perish, he would have entrusted
                        his work to other than these. He would have entrusted it to useless, good-for-nothing
                        men. He would have entrusted it to madmen. Having given his work to such men as these,
                        His word will continue to future generations of our races, even although they are
                        no longer here. The story of the Gospel will continue to make a sounding noise throughout
                        the land. It will sound as we sang in our opening hymn, from hill to hill; the spirit
                        of prayer will descend from river to river, and all men shall acknowledge and receive
                        it everywhere. I declare to you, as it was declared last Sabbath in solemn tones to
                        our people at the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Mgwali</span>, by the good <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Wangemann</span>, now with us, that "God hath highly exalted His son, the Lord Jesus, and given him
                        a name which is above every name, and that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
                        of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every
                        tongue shall confess that Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father." Yes!
                        Every knee shall bow sooner or later, and every tongue shall confess that he is God.

                     <p class="p  ">Now what are my reasons for saying that the Gospel having once been introduced will
                        continue with us? Here is my stronghold:—Is it not this that while these men have
                        been planting, they were at the same time praying? Has <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Brownlee</span> ceased to pray? Have our missionaries ceased to pray? No, from the day that he set
                        foot on <span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span> his life has been one long connected prayer. Now, have these vanished like water
                        spilled on the ground? I tell you these men have kindled a fire which will spread
                        until it envelopes the whole of this country in one brilliant blaze of light. I tell
                        you that they have fixed a pole like that of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kaffir</span>—boom and wild plum, bring forth leaves and flowers, and bear fruit, although he who planted them becomes
                        unknown to anyone.

                     <p class="p  ">This day, commemorative of the 50<span class="sup ">th</span> year of our Father’s labours amongst us, tells us this solemn fact that the shadows
                        of the evening time of his life are descending from the mountains; they are spreading
                        away in the distance. In his journey homewards he has crossed all the rivers, and
                        but few remain before him to cross now. The day is drawing to a close, the sun is
                        fast declining. It says to us that he also probably is looking wistfully towards home.
                        It says to us that by this act we are convoying him so far, although our prayer is
                        that his Maker would give us the loan of him for a little longer.

                        declared to us as having died for our offences. Though we fall, we will rise nearing
                        gradually until we arrive in that blessed, that everlasting home of which you came
                        to tell us that it is in heaven above. Would that your Father in his own time would
                        relieve you from all your earthly labours, being able to say, "Lord now lettest thou

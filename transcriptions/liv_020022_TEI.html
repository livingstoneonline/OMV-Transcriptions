                           it has a more immediate reference to our aged father before us has a reference also
                           to ourselves; this day has reference to us because it <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: recalls">recals</span> the work which God has wrought amongst us by his aged servant as well as by his other

                           which are suggested by what is being done under the sun of this day. I become so because
                           of the number of thoughts which spring up one by one involuntarily in my heart, all
                           of them great all of them wonderful, some of them of a painful, others of a pleasant,
                           nature. I feel perplexed as I look around me this day and see these white men our
                           Fathers, our Teachers, who think it no shame to speak of us as being "flesh of their
                           flesh and bone of their bone." On such a day as this I look above and beyond all these
                           petty differences and distinctions of caste and colour, and look upon the great and
                           noble work in which they have been engaged for us, and as I do so, these men rise
                           in my esteem and regard to a point of excellence and grandeur such as I never realised
                           before.

                        <p class="p  ">I say I am perplexed on this day of sorrow when I look upon him whom we have come
                           to honour, assembled as we are in such numbers, because to my mind although he has
                           long proclaimed aloud the word of his master, it is as if his voice this day sounded
                           in a louder and clearer tone.  Let us for a moment go back on the object of this day’s
                           gathering, let us take a retrospective view of our Father since his arrival amongst
                           us. What is it they say to us in this address which they present him? They say it
                           is fifty years since he left the land of his birth beyond the seas, since he left
                           his friends and closed the door of his home against himself, so that those earthly
                           endearments which are the support and the stay of a man’s life might never hinder
                           him in the work to which he had devoted himself.

                           questions, one great answer appears,—that the love of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
                           surpasses and transcends the knowledge of man, and the wisdom of man, and the judgment
                           of man, and the thoughts of man, and that there is nothing on earth to compare with

                           to an unknown country and amongst a nation that was not even of his own colour, there
                           to retrieve his character. He was actuated solely by the principle of love to Christ.

                           his work to other than these. He would have entrusted it to useless, good-for-nothing
                           men. He would have entrusted it to madmen. Having given his work to such men as these,
                           His word will continue to future generations of our races, even although they are
                           no longer here. The story of the Gospel will continue to make a sounding noise throughout
                           the land. It will sound as we sang in our opening hymn, from hill to hill; the spirit
                           of prayer will descend from river to river, and all men shall acknowledge and receive
                           it everywhere. I declare to you, as it was declared last Sabbath in solemn tones to
                           our people at the <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Mgwali</span>, by the good <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Wangemann</span>, now with us, that "God hath highly exalted His son, the Lord Jesus, and given him
                           a name which is above every name, and that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow,
                           of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every
                           tongue shall confess that Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father." Yes!
                           Every knee shall bow sooner or later, and every tongue shall confess that he is God.

                           continue with us? Here is my stronghold:—Is it not this that while these men have
                           been planting, they were at the same time praying? Has <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Brownlee</span> ceased to pray? Have our missionaries ceased to pray? No, from the day that he set
                           foot on <span class="country" title="A country.">South Africa</span> his life has been one long connected prayer. Now, have these vanished like water
                           spilled on the ground? I tell you these men have kindled a fire which will spread
                           until it envelopes the whole of this country in one brilliant blaze of light. I tell
                           you that they have fixed a pole like that of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kaffir</span>—boom and wild plum, bring forth leaves and flowers, and bear fruit, although he who planted them becomes
                           unknown to anyone.

                           away in the distance. In his journey homewards he has crossed all the rivers, and
                           but few remain before him to cross now. The day is drawing to a close, the sun is
                           fast declining. It says to us that he also probably is looking wistfully towards home.
                           It says to us that by this act we are convoying him so far, although our prayer is
                           that his Maker would give us the loan of him for a little longer.

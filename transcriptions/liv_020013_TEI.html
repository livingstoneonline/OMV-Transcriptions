                              The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span> were very cruel and unkind. But one day, near a place called <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Bussorah</span>, in <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Persia</span>, an <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> ship came and caught the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arab</span> ship; we were all taken on board and carried to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Bombay</span>.

So plenty of boys said they would go. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Price</span> chose six, and I was the leader of the party.

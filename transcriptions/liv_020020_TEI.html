                        on his way to <span class="country" title="A country.">England</span>, has been forwarded to us
                        for publication:—
                        <span class="seg center caps  ">Statement of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sechele</span>, Paramount
                           Chief of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bakwaina</span></span>
                        I am <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Sechele</span>, son of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Motchuazele</span>, chief of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bakuena</span>.
                        My father died while I was still young. After his death
                        the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span> under <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mosilikatsi</span> made war upon my country, and destroyed my town. I fled with my people to
                        another part of our country near the desert. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span> afterwards came out against us several times; but
                        we always escaped from them by going into the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Kalagare
                           desert</span>, where they could not follow us, because they did
                        not know where water was to be found, and again 
                        returning when our enemies had gone back. We were 
                        living at a place called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kopong</span>, when we heard that
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mosilikatsi</span> had been attached by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span>. Fearing
                        that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span> in flying from the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span> might fall
                        upon us, we removed to another part of our country, to a
                        place called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Lopepe</span>. We lived there some time
                        when we heard that <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dingaan</span> had attached the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span>, and
                        driven them out of the country. We then removed back
                        to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Shakwane</span>, the site of one of our former towns. About
                        five years afterwards I was again attacked by the 
                        <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span>. Hearing that some <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span> were hunting on the
                        <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Mariqua</span>, I went to them and requested their assistance
                        against my enemies. They answered me, "the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Matabele</span>
                        have not attacked our country, therefore we cannot 
                        interfere." These were the first <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span> I had ever seen. I
                        then went back and collected my people together, and
                        removed with them to a place called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Chonuane</span>, in the
                        <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bakhatla</span> country, near the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Mariqua</span>, on account of the
                        game which was there in large numbers. At this place
                        I was visited by some of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Potgieter</span>'s people. They had
                        brought cattle for sale, these I purchased for ivory. I
                        also allowed them to hire some of my people to go 
                        and work for them. About three years after this, 
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Livingstone</span> came to live with me, and to preach the Word of 
                        God. After a while, a message came by some of 
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mokhatla</span>'s men from the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span> to say  I must give up all my guns.
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Livingstone</span> then went to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span> to ask them why they
                        wished to take away my guns. They said it was because
                        I had come into their country. Some of these guns I had
                        purchased from <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Boers</span>, others from <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Griquas</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>
                        traders. About one year after this, I removed to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Kolobeng</span>
                        in my own country. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> now sent me repeated
                        orders to say I must stop the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> from travelling
                        into my country, and also to say that they were the
                        masters of the land. I always refused to comply with
                        their demands. They, however, contined sending
                        letters to me threatening me with war, if I did not obey
                        them. I refused to comply with any of their orders.
                        I told them I would sooner die than become their slave.
                        The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> I said were my friends; I received 
                        everything from them. I also told them I was not at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Chonuane</span>
                        any longer, which they said was their country. Another
                        reason why I refused to submit to their rule was, I
                        knew they ill-treated those tribes already under them,
                        taking away their cattle and children without cause. I had
                        heard also from some of my people who had been working 
                        for the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> of the manner in which they had treated
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mangkopane</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mokopane</span>, two chiefs to the
                        eastward of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Mariqua</span>, how they had attacked these
                        chiefs without cause, and taken numbers of cattle and
                        children from them, and that maby of these children
                        were sold. Things went on in this manner till the time
                        that the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> made a treaty with <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Pretorius</span>. After
                        that, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> called upon all the chiefs to attend a
                        meeting. I refused to attend, because I did not 
                        consider myself under them. I learnt, however, from those 
                        who did attend, that they called upon us all to submit to
                        their laws, and if we refused they would make war upon
                        us. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> said that the country had been given to them
                        by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>, and that they had also been given them leave
                        to do as they pleased with the black people. About five
                        months after this, <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moselele</span>, chief of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Bakhatla</span>, came 
                        to my place, he said, he was flying from the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> who 
                        were coming in a large body to attack us. I told him I
                        was glad he had come to me, we could now fight 
                        together, as I also was determined not to become a slave.
                        I also called upon <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Senthue</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Segostsane</span> to join me
                        that we might be able to make a stand against the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>.
                        They each sent a number of men, and these I supplied
                        with powder and lead. They came on a Saturday, and
                        sent me an order to give up <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moselele</span>; I told them that
                        <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Moselele</span> was my father's son, and therefore I could not
                        give him up. I sent them word that the next day was
                        God's day, I wished therefore they would defer saying 
                        anything till Monday, when I would speak to them. On 
                        Monday morning, they sent one of my own men whom
                        they had taken prisoner, to say I must send all the women
                        and children out of the place, as they intended to fight.
                        I sent back a message to them saying, we had better
                        speak first. They said there is no tome to speak now, if
                        you are afraid to fight give up all your guns, all your
                        oxen, all your sheep, all your goats, and all your 
                        childdren; also your corn, which we want for our horses. I
                        said, my children and my guns I cannot give you. These
                        can only be taken when I am dead. They commenced
                        the attack, my people tried to fight, but they could not
                        fight with <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>. The tribes whom I had called to my
                        assistance fled at the first fire. I was surrounded on a
                        hill, with only a few men, by the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>. I fought till it
                        was dark, and retreated to another hill. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> took,
                        I think, one thousand children from my town, two
                        hundred women, burnt my town, took all the things
                        belonging to the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>, which had been left in
                        my charge, most of the cattle, sheep, and goats,
                        belonging to myself and people. Eighty-nine of my
                        men fell in the fight. I retreated with my people
                        (those I had left), to the borders of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Kalagare</span>. The 
                        <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> have since sent to me desiring peace. I told them
                        I wanted my children back, and those of my people,--
                        and then I would make peace. They said, they could
                        not give them back. I now determined to go to the
                        <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span>, and request them to reprimand the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>, and
                        restore peace to my country. If the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">English</span> do not
                        assist me, I am a dead man. I do not know where to
                        go. The <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> will not allow us to live any longer.
                        What grieves me very much also is, that I shall not be
                        able to hear the word of God any longer, the 
                        missionarries being also driven out of the country.

                     <hr class="milestone quarterline center">
                     <br><p class="p ">I left <span class="">Zanzibar</span> to travel in the <span class="">interior of <span class="">Africa</span></span> <span class="">about sixteen years ago</span>. I went partly to trade in ivory, and partly for the purpose of visiting unexplored
                        regions of that great country. I first travelled to <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Ujiji">Ugiji</span></span> on the shore of the great lake of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tanganyika">Tanganika</span></span>. I then crossed the lake, and went twenty-seven days' journey down its <span class="">western coast</span> by boat to <span class="">Umaroongoo</span>, which is situated near the <span class="">south end of the lake</span>. A broad river, called the <span class="">Maroongoo</span>, flows into the lake near this place. From <span class="">Umaroongoo</span>, I travelled south, and visited the country of a powerful Chief whose title is 'the Casembe.' I first went seven days journey to <span class="">Peto</span>, thence seven days to <span class="">Karembo Makoonga</span>; in three days more to <span class="">Karoongwesi</span>, and thence in three days to <span class="">Roonda</span>, a large town, where the Casembe resides. <span class="">Roonda</span> is situated on the banks of a large river called the <span class="">Ruapoora</span>,--the stream flows North towards the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tanganyika">Tanganika</span> lake</span>. The Casembe is a Negro, by name <span class="">Sultan Chareka</span>. The people are armed with muskets. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and poultry procurable at <span class="">Roonda</span>, but no horses, horned cattle, or camels. The markets of <span class="">Roonda</span> are well supplied with meat, fish, grain, and vegetables. There is no money: Venetian beads form the circulating medium. The people appear
                        comfortable and contented, the country is everywhere cultivated, and the inhabitants are numerous. There are no stone buildings,--all
                        the houses are constructed of wood or mud, with roofs of grass or leaves. The Casembe governs with mildness and justice, and the roads are quite safe for travellers. After residing for some time at <span class="">Roonda</span>, I went a journey of twenty-five days to the great copper-mines; they are situated
                        to the <span class="">west of <span class="">Roonda</span></span>, and the country  all forms part of the <span class="">dominions of the Casembe</span>; it is well peopled and cultivated. The copper-mines are situated in a large range
                        of mountains; a great many people are employed at them, and the copper is taken for
                        sale all over the country. After
                        
                        	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
                        <span class="fw   " title=""><span class="center small "><span class="">NARRATIVE OF <span class="">SAID BIN HABEEB</span></span>.</span> <span class="right ">147</span></span>
                        smelting, about seventy-five pounds weight of copper are sold for four cubits of American sheeting; iron is everywhere abundant, and the miners' tools are made from iron procured in the neighbourhood. A large town called <span class="">Katanza</span> is situated near the copper-mines, it contains a greater population than <span class="">Roonda</span>. The bazars at <span class="">Katanza</span> are well supplied with rice, Indian corn, jowarree, bajree, vegetables of various sorts; sheep and goats are plentiful; cotton is abundant, and is made into cloth in the country. There are no horses or horned cattle. Around <span class="">Katanza</span>, the country  is generally populous, and the land well cultivated; but there are also extensive
                        forests and mountains abounding in lions, elephants, and other wild animals. From the copper-mines, or "Masden Safr," it is a journey of three days to <span class="">Waramba</span>, the country of an independent chief. The town of <span class="">Katanza</span> and the copper-mines are situated in the dominions of a chief, whose title is 'Manene.' A large river, called the <span class="">Rafira</span>, flows past <span class="">Katanza</span>, and joins the <span class="">Ruapoora</span> to the North. I remained two months at <span class="">Katanza</span>; it is a quiet peaceable place, with very few robbers: the people always treated
                        me in a friendly manner, and goods of all kinds were abundant. In payment of purchases
                        in the markets, you break a few beads off a string, and give them in exchange. There
                        is no coined money. I suffered but little inconvenience from my ignorance of the languages
                        of the various countries through which I passed, because the <span class="">Africans</span>, who accompanied me from <span class="">Zanzibar</span>, acquired these languages with surprising rapidity, and always made themselves understood.
                     </p>
                     <br><p class="p ">From <span class="">Katanza</span>, I travelled in a westerly direction, and, after two months, reached a country called
                        <span class="">Boira</span>.  The country through which I passed is divided into petty states, the chiefs treat travellers well, but it is necessary to stay amongst them and gain their goodwill. The country
                         was generally thickly peopled, and grain, fowls, sheep, and vegetables, always procurable in abundance.
                     </p>
                     <br><p class="p ">From <span class="">Boira</span>, I went a journey of seventeen days to "<span class="">Warengeh</span>:" the people of this country  are the most barbarous I met with during all my travels; they go entirely naked,
                        and pull out all their upper front teeth. From <span class="">Warengeh</span>, I travelled in two months to a country called <span class="">Ugengeh</span>, not far from the river <span class="">Zambesi</span>; the chief ruler of this country  is named "<span class="">Makororo</span>:" the people are a handsome race, many are quite fair with long hair flowing over
                        the neck, others are as black as negroes. In
                        
                        	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
                        <span class="fw   " title=""><span class="left ">148</span>	<span class="center small "><span class="">NARRATIVE OF <span class="">SAID BIN HABEEB</span></span>.</span></span>
                        <span class="">Ugengeh</span>, the people possess abundance of horned cattle, horses, sheep, and goats: they travel about, and carry on a considerable trade. From <span class="">Ugengeh</span>, I went in thirty days' journey through a fine rich country to <span class="">Lui</span>: there is very little forest in this part; cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry are everywhere abundant. I reached the city of <span class="">Loanda</span>, on the shore of the great ocean in eighty-days' journey from <span class="">Lui</span>. I  remained at <span class="">Loanda</span> twenty-five days, and then returned into the <span class="">interior</span>. I travelled about in various directions, trading in ivory, and visited the city
                        of <span class="">Loanda</span> three times. I resided at various towns in the <span class="">interior</span>; and, at length, having been absent from my own country  for so many years, I resolved to return to <span class="">Zanzibar</span>. I travelled east until I reached the river <span class="">Zambesi</span>, and then proceeded north until I reached the great lake <span class="">Nyassa</span>. I travelled seventeen days along the shore of the lake  towards its northern end, in order to cross it at a narrow point, and I then returned
                        to the <span class="">east coast</span> through the <span class="">country of the Miyan and Magindo tribes</span>.  The lake of <span class="">Nyassa</span> is of vast extent, a large frigate could manœuvre on it. The country all around is
                        very rich; cotton grows everywhere in great abundance, and the natives weave it into cloth.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="p ">During all my journeys, I met with hospitality and friendship, and I intend returning
                        to the <span class="">interior of <span class="">Africa</span></span> after arranging my affairs here. I met <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span> near the <span class="">Zambesi</span>, and conveyed <span class="">letters</span> for him to <span class="">Loanda</span>. I have never written down anything I observed during my travels, because <span class="">Arabs</span> take no interest in the discovery of foreign countries, and do not care to hear of
                        anything unconnected with the acquisition of riches.

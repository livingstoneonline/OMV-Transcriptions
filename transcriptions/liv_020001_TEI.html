I went partly to trade in ivory, and partly for the purpose of visiting unexplored
                        regions of that great country. I first travelled to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Ujiji">Ugiji</span></span> on the shore of the great lake of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tanganyika">Tanganika</span></span>. I then crossed the lake, and went twenty-seven days' journey down its western coast by boat to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Umaroongoo</span>, which is situated near the south end of the lake. A broad river, called the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Maroongoo</span>, flows into the lake near this place. From <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Umaroongoo</span>, I travelled south, and visited the country of a powerful Chief whose title is 'the Casembe.' I first went seven days journey to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Peto</span>, thence seven days to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Karembo Makoonga</span>; in three days more to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Karoongwesi</span>, and thence in three days to <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span>, a large town, where the Casembe resides. <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span> is situated on the banks of a large river called the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Ruapoora</span>,--the stream flows North towards the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity."><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tanganyika">Tanganika</span> lake</span>. The Casembe is a Negro, by name <span class="">Sultan Chareka</span>. The people are armed with muskets. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and poultry procurable at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span>, but no horses, horned cattle, or camels. The markets of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span> are well supplied with meat, fish, grain, and vegetables. There is no money: Venetian beads form the circulating medium. The people appear
                        comfortable and contented, the country is everywhere cultivated, and the inhabitants are numerous. There are no stone buildings,--all
                        the houses are constructed of wood or mud, with roofs of grass or leaves. The Casembe governs with mildness and justice, and the roads are quite safe for travellers. After residing for some time at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span>, I went a journey of twenty-five days to the great copper-mines; they are situated
                        to the west of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span>, and the country  all forms part of the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">dominions of the Casembe</span>; it is well peopled and cultivated. The copper-mines are situated in a large range
                        of mountains; a great many people are employed at them, and the copper is taken for
                        sale all over the country. After
                        
                        	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>

                        smelting, about seventy-five pounds weight of copper are sold for four cubits of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">American</span> sheeting; iron is everywhere abundant, and the miners' tools are made from iron procured in the neighbourhood. A large town called <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span> is situated near the copper-mines, it contains a greater population than <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Roonda</span>. The bazars at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span> are well supplied with rice, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Indian</span> corn, jowarree, bajree, vegetables of various sorts; sheep and goats are plentiful; cotton is abundant, and is made into cloth in the country. There are no horses or horned cattle. Around <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span>, the country  is generally populous, and the land well cultivated; but there are also extensive
                        forests and mountains abounding in lions, elephants, and other wild animals. From the copper-mines, or "Masden Safr," it is a journey of three days to <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Waramba</span>, the country of an independent chief. The town of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span> and the copper-mines are situated in the dominions of a chief, whose title is 'Manene.' A large river, called the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Rafira</span>, flows past <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span>, and joins the <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Ruapoora</span> to the North. I remained two months at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span>; it is a quiet peaceable place, with very few robbers: the people always treated
                        me in a friendly manner, and goods of all kinds were abundant. In payment of purchases
                        in the markets, you break a few beads off a string, and give them in exchange. There
                        is no coined money. I suffered but little inconvenience from my ignorance of the languages
                        of the various countries through which I passed, because the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Africans</span>, who accompanied me from <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>, acquired these languages with surprising rapidity, and always made themselves understood.

                     <p class="p  ">From <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Katanza</span>, I travelled in a westerly direction, and, after two months, reached a country called
                        <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Boira</span>.  The country through which I passed is divided into petty states, the chiefs treat travellers well, but it is necessary to stay amongst them and gain their goodwill. The country
                         was generally thickly peopled, and grain, fowls, sheep, and vegetables, always procurable in abundance.

                     <p class="p  ">From <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Boira</span>, I went a journey of seventeen days to "<span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Warengeh</span>:" the people of this country  are the most barbarous I met with during all my travels; they go entirely naked,
                        and pull out all their upper front teeth. From <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Warengeh</span>, I travelled in two months to a country called <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ugengeh</span>, not far from the river <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zambesi</span>; the chief ruler of this country  is named "<span class="">Makororo</span>:" the people are a handsome race, many are quite fair with long hair flowing over

                        <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ugengeh</span>, the people possess abundance of horned cattle, horses, sheep, and goats: they travel about, and carry on a considerable trade. From <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Ugengeh</span>, I went in thirty days' journey through a fine rich country to <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Lui</span>: there is very little forest in this part; cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry are everywhere abundant. I reached the city of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Loanda</span>, on the shore of the great ocean in eighty-days' journey from <span class="placeName" title="A formally-named place.">Lui</span>. I  remained at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Loanda</span> twenty-five days, and then returned into the interior. I travelled about in various
                        directions, trading in ivory, and visited the city of <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Loanda</span> three times. I resided at various towns in the interior; and, at length, having been
                        absent from my own country  for so many years, I resolved to return to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. I travelled east until I reached the river <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zambesi</span>, and then proceeded north until I reached the great lake <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nyassa</span>. I travelled seventeen days along the shore of the lake  towards its northern end, in order to cross it at a narrow point, and I then returned
                        to the east coast through the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">country of the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Miyan</span> and <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Magindo</span> tribes</span>.  The lake of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Nyassa</span> is of vast extent, a large frigate could manœuvre on it. The country all around is

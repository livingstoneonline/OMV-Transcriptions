                        EMGWALI, October 1873
                        MY KIND FRIENDS,—For a long time I
                        have wished to thank you for what you have
                        done for me. Beloved friends, to-day I thank
                        you for what you have done for my son and
                        for myself. I thank you for what he was
                        taught, and for what he was prepared for, by
                        your means. From the beginning you acted
                        with great wisdom towards him, and thereby
                        conferred privileges and marvellous blessings
                        upon us all. You opened up every path for
                        him by which he was directed in the way of
                        salvation, and which you also showed unto
                        his people as well as to himself and to his
                        family.
                        Beloved, your work to my son I represent
                        with the words which were said respecting
                        man : The Creator first prepared a place for
                        man before He created him. When He had
                        finished all that was right for man, He created
                        him, and placed him in the midst of every
                        advantage. His commandment instructed
                        him, like him who has departed. Thus it
                        was so.
                        What can I speak to you ? Dearly beloved,
                        that which you began did you not finish ?
                        You gave the blood of your blood* to my son.
                        I have seen it with my own eyes. That event
                        taught us to know your habits, your disposition,
                        and your speech. That great event
                        united us very closely together. In effect it
                        seemed to say to my son : 'Tiyo Soga, go,
                        take this great enlightener amongst your
                        countrymen.' My friends, what can I say to
                        you ? He is gone to the place prepared for
                        him : look there for him ! Pardon me in
                        referring to this matter. Beloved, what gift
                        can be more highly esteemed than this ?
                        Rejoice, beloved ! we also rejoice with the
                        churches in Scotland. Rejoice ye ! Canzibe,
                        the bright, the morning star of spring, has
                        already risen upon Africa. The first teacher
                        belonging to our countrymen was sent forth
                        by you. Be glad, ye people of Caffraria !
                        Amaxosa, the first home of my son, now lying
                        desolate and forlorn, speaks of your laborious
                        toil. Rejoice ye ! These five gum trees still
                        standing remind me that, while the desolate
                        * Referring to his marriage.
                        
                        and deserted homes of our countrymen are
                        covered with the couch grass, it is not so with
                        respect to that in which my son abides this
                        day. His home is now far distant from these
                        gum trees. Vain, then, is it for you to care
                        so much, and to be so anxious for the things
                        of this world.
                        But now there is a thing present to-day by
                        which I see him,* and yet do not see him. By
                        the kindness of one whom I do not know,
                        there is the stone that preserves the name of
                        my son, in order that the generation present,
                        and generations yet to come, may be told of
                        him whom we so greatly loved. That stone
                        is the first, so far as I know, that has been
                        erected by you (the churches in Scotland),
                        and on that account my heart is exceeding
                        glad.
                        My friends, I thank that kind friend for the
                        words which he wrote for that stone. I continue
                        still to hear them. It is written that a
                        prophet said to a certain man, 'Go, wash
                        seven times in Jordan, and thou shalt be
                        made whole.' He went. But the prophet did
                        not personally appear : he merely spoke the
                        word, although unseen. My thanks I give to
                        that unseen friend who wrote ; and true it is
                        that the works of a good man will follow
                        him.
                        There is one also who long ago began to
                        break up the new ground in my son, and who,
                        although not now in this world, is entitled to
                        my thanks. I thank our old missionary, Mr.
                        Chalmers.
                        It is proper also that I should thank Mr.
                        Govan, who so greatly benefited my son by
                        his instructions while he was under his hand.
                        Mr. Niven I also thank for all his labours in
                        behalf of my son.  Messrs. Cumming, Chalmers,
                        Sclater, R. Ross, J. Davidson, Longdon,
                        and R. Irvine—I thank them all for their
                        labour in connection with the burial of my
                        son.
                        My beloved friends, what more can I say?
                        I conclude with respectful salutations. Oh,
                        pray for me to the Lord, my friends, that
                        when I reach that day which has neither a
                        yesterday nor a to-morrow—a day which has
                        no end—I may receive strength to sustain me
                        in my unutterable weakness. —May you live
                        happy!
                        NOSUTU SOGA JOTELO,
                        * She refers here to the marble tablet set up in the Emgwali Church, presented by

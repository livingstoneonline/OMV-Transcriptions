                        <p class="p  ">MADAM,—Having written a short account of some incidents connected with my life, I
                           return my grateful and sincere thanks to you for the great interest you have taken
                           in my education, by which means I have been brought from African darkness to a knowledge
                           of the comforts of a civilized and social life. Hitherto, for these ten years, I have
                           experienced your benevolent care and tuition, and have been elevated far above many
                           of my poor countrymen, whose minds are lying with the dust. To whom should I ascribe
                           this work, if not to the patroness of my education? To whom should I dedicate these
                           incidents, if not to the guardian of my younger years? Yes, Madam; to you, and to
                           you alone, I now acknowledge my gratitude for the many benefits which I enjoy. Although
                           far distant from kindred and relations—although far from the care of an overlooking
                           mother—I have found in you, Madam,
                           
                           
                           	<span class="pb-title">iv</span>
                           a truly good substitute for these wants. I have experienced your goodness in sending
                           me to school, and putting me in the hands of one whose whole interest was absorbed
                           in teaching the young idea how to shoot. In whatever  my lot may be cast, I hope your private admonitions will render me impregnable when
                           attacked by the many vices prevalent in the world.
                        </p>

                           the description of his country in eloquent language, but to give, in the form of recollections,
                           a brief account of incidents connected with his own life. Having been urged by several
                           friends to write an account of his life, he hopes that this small work will meet the
                           approbation of all who read it. He will not fail, therefore, to make it as interesting

                           to read this narrative. Great anxiety has been felt by geographical and other societies,

                           of Africa and its products. Of these, the Author is sorry that he cannot satisfy his
                           readers, having been taken away from his country at a very early age. Of all the quarters
                           of the globe, Africa is the least known. Ignorance, barbarity, and superstition, prevail
                           in its centre, and the unhealthy nature of its climate renders it almost impracticable
                           for any European to travel into it, and satisfy an enquiring public. Taking a natural
                           view of the country, it is barren, sandy, and mountainous, interspersed with a few
                           green spots, called oases, or made fertile by the inundation of some river in the
                           rainy season. Taking an artificial view of those regions, you will perceive nothing
                           but a few small huts here and there, built by the inhabitants for their own accommodation.
                           The Northern and Southern States can boast of a little civilization, being frequented

                           and inhabited by the dwellers of the north temperate zone. In taking a political view
                           of the centre of Africa, the enquirer will find the country divided into a number
                           of small principalities, who maintain their dignity by making war against each other.
                           The captives taken in these wars are sold as slaves, being purchased by Arabs and
                           Turks on the east coast, and Spaniards, Portuguese, and Americans, on the west. Thus
                           many of these poor creatures are brought to a level with the brute beasts, by the
                           inhabitants of that federal government, (the United States), who pretend to profess
                           the principles of freedom and Christianity in their truest light. The selling of these
                           captives stimulates others to kidnap some of the poor natives, and carry on a brutal
                           traffic in buying and selling human victims for the gratification of their own

                           <p class="p  ">SURROUNDED by some beautiful mountain scenery, and situated between Durfur and Abyssinia,
                              is a small valley going under the denomination of Tegla, or Tegeley. To this valley
                              I stretch forth my affections, giving it the endearing appellation of my native home
                              and father land. It was there that I was born; 'twas there that I received the fond
                              looks of a loving mother; and it was there that I set my feet for the first time upon
                              a world full of cares, trials, difficulties, and dangers. I cannot give the exact
                              limits of the valley of Tegla. There were, however, three Chiefs who exercised power
                              over its inhabitants. Mehemet Chammaroo (under whose government my father was) ruled
                              the centre; while two other princes had the sway, one on each side. Like many of the
                              regions bordering on the equator, the valley of Tegla is exposed to the excessive
                              heat of the burning sun. Its seasons, properly speaking, can only be divided into
                              two parts—the rainy and the dry season. In the rainy season
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">12</span>
                              agriculture is carried on by the farmer on a very small scale—the only substitute
                              for a plough being a long pole, with something similar to a shovel attached to the
                              end of it. With this instrument the surface of the ground is broken, after which the
                              seed (consisting of Indian corn and maize) is sown in small quantities at certain
                              distances from each other. After it has grown a certain length, part of it is transplanted
                              into different fields, thus giving the crop full scope and encouragement to grow.
                              When the corn begins to change colour, the rainy season declines, till at length the
                              refulgent rays of the sun perceive the inhabitant of the vale preparing to reap his
                              harvest. The rain is over, the dry season is on; many begin to reap the fruits of
                              their labour.<span class="">*</span></p>

                                 and yet the river Nile has its yearly inundations. The rainy season in the valley
                                 of Tegla, and its neighbouring countries forms tributaries to the Nile; makes it overflow
                                 its banks; spreads fertility through the muddy soil of the country; and supplies its
                                 dependant natives with the necessaries of life.

                              The shearers are not formed of a number of mercenaries, who expect to pocket shillings
                              and half-crowns at the end of their period of labour; but such is the social nature
                              of the people among themselves, that they exchange services with each other. A large
                              concourse of them assemble

                              of shearing is generally ended with dancing, of which amusement they are very fond.
                              The reader, perhaps, will inquire what sort of drink these dancers use? His mind will
                              very likely answer, Jamaica rum, French brandy, or Irish whisky. But no; water is
                              their chief drink. They have a thick intoxicating liquor, which they make from the
                              Indian corn; but such a luxury is only used on extraordinary occasions. After all
                              their harvest festivities are over, they give themselves up to all the indolent habits
                              prevalent in these eastern countries; and lounge in their booths until the appearance
                              of the skies proclaim the distant approach of the rainy season.

                              has to dig wells to supply his household with water; in the rainy, he has only to
                              go to the rivulets for that supply. The dry season carries off all traces of water;
                              scorches all the grass and green trees; occasions deep chasms in the earth; and leaves
                              the poor native nothing to depend upon but his industry in the rainy season. Indian
                              corn, maize, and a flock of goats are generally

                              many are kept in its vicinity. Prince Chammaroo's dominions had only three wells.
                              The different districts regularly awaited their turn in receiving a supply of water.
                              The religion is Paganism, mixed with several Mahommedan rites, such as the shaving
                              of their heads, circumcision, and fasting; but their chief attention is attracted
                              to the sun, the moon, and stars.

                           <p class="p  ">About a month after the ceremony of circumcision, a number of young men convene at
                              the house where the rite had been performed, and sally from thence through the country
                              on hunting excursions. Everything falls a prey to the hunter's knife and spear; and
                              on these occasions the poultry-yard suffers most, while the poor owners are mere lookers
                              on at these depredations, it being deemed sacred to interfere with the behaviour of
                              these young men. Fasting is also very strictly observed by the devotee, one month

                              to rest. The houses in the valley of Tegla are built in a style peculiar to themselves.
                              Every room is built about ten or twenty yards from <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: each">eaeh</span> other, of a round form, with thatch roofs. The under part of the rooms are built
                              of stones and mud; the roofs are thatched with the maize and Indian corn canes. Four

                              form a respectable dwelling, the whole of which are enclosed by a wall about five
                              feet high, thus leaving an open square in the centre. In the great heat of the dry
                              season, this square is used by the indwellers for sleeping apartments, where they
                              all lie down on the floor, and cover themselves with a large white sheet. If disturbed
                              by any wild beasts during the night, they betake themselves to the inner rooms. My
                              father's house consisted of two bedrooms, a kitchen, a mill room, and a goat room,
                              or fold. Goats' milk is considered a very wholesome commodity; it has a pleasing sweet
                              taste, which attracts the palate to it, and is said to possess a certain virtue in
                              medicinal qualities. The junior male members of the family are employed in taking
                              care of the flock. When a number of them are going in the same direction they mix
                              their flocks together, and each in his turn mutually takes care of the whole flock
                              till evening, when, by a cry peculiar to each goat-herd, his flock separates from
                              the rest, and follows him. He then takes them home, gets them milked, and secures
                              them in the fold. Those which are great favourites are generally taken into the sleeping
                              apartments. The milk must not be allowed to stand till the middle of next day, else
                              it would get quite sour. In order to prevent this catastrophe they either drink it
                              or make butter of it. Their mode of churning is as follows:—
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">The gourd or calabash, which grows plentifully in these districts, is a plant something
                              similar to

                              a melon plant. It's fruit is like a melon, but the inside is bitter. The gourd melons
                              grow to different sizes, so that the natives make dishes and plates out of them, by
                              cutting them into halves. The churn, however, requires a whole melon, and one of the
                              largest is taken for that purpose. After a part of the pith is taken out, it is filled
                              with water, and permitted to stand till the inside is quite rotten. It is then cleaned
                              out, secured into a rope basket, suspended to the roof of one of the rooms, so as
                              it can be reached by a person standing, and there it serves as a churn,—the dairymaid's
                              work being to put the milk into it, and work it to and fro with her hands. No cream
                              is extracted.

                           <p class="p  ">The butter is generally used for rubbing their skins; and very little clothing being
                              used, many of them could be seen standing out in the sun like a number of polished
                              statues. After washing themselves with water, they never think that they are complete
                              till they rub some butter on their skins. The dress among the higher classes is a
                              long wide gown, reaching to the ancles, and wide open sleeves, so as not to confine

                              wide plaid, which they tie round their body, and over one of their shoulders, leaving
                              the other quite free; while in length it only reaches to the knees. This forms all
                              their variety of dress.

                           <p class="p  ">YOUTH is the period in which true happiness is enjoyed. It is the time when all trials
                              and difficulties seem to lie in oblivion; and it is then that all principles can be
                              instilled into the tender mind. The mind in youth is not prejudiced, builds many castles
                              in the air although without any symptoms of ambition, is pleased and always desires
                              to please. It is like the shoot of a tender flower ere its leaves expand. It is the
                              germ on which strong propensities and sentiments are framed. It is in youth that the
                              stronger faculties of the artist, the genius, and the mechanic are pictured. None
                              of these propensities, however, were predominant in my mind while home was my residence.
                              Being the oldest of the boys, my pride was raised to no small degree when I beheld
                              my father preparing a farm for me. This event filled my mind with the grand anticipation
                              of leaving the goats to my brother, who was then beginning to work a little. While
                              my father was making these preparations, I had the constant charge of the goats; and
                              being accompanied by two other boys who resided near

                              my father's house, we wandered many miles from home, by which means we acquired an
                              acquaintance with the different districts of the country. 'Twas while in these rambles
                              with my companions that I became the victim of the slaveholder. While tending our
                              flock between two hills, we spied two men shaping their course towards us. They inquired
                              whether we had any goats for them, a term quite common in that country. Our reply
                              was, of course, in the negative; but they merely used this craft in order to deprive
                              us of suspicion. Myself being nearest to them, I was firmly secured in their hands,
                              and forced away whether I would or not.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">On showing symptoms of resistance, one of them procured a green twig, and whipped
                              me till the blood was falling in drops from my legs. After proceeding some miles,
                              we came to a house, where I was tied with ropes hand and foot, and laid down to rest.
                              Next morning, before dawn of day, my cruel master took the ropes off my legs, and,
                              setting me on a certain direction, desired me to walk while he followed with a large
                              whip. Terrified out of my judgment, I saw that there was nothing to be done but either
                              do or suffer. I of course chose the former. This was rather a harsh treatment for
                              a child of eight years of age. Commencing before sunrise, we continued our journey
                              till the middle of the day, when we arrived at a village. This village went under
                              the name of Tegla. At the village of Tegla my inhuman master disposed of me, and returned
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">19</span>
                              home. On entering the house of my new master, what was my astonishment on seeing an
                              old acquaintance there, a girl with whom I had an interview a few weeks previous.
                              She, poor creature, had also fallen into the hands of the enemy only a few days before
                              myself. This girl, whose name was Medina, admonished me on this occasion, telling
                              me to do whatever I was desired, assuring me that the white man would not care for
                              taking our lives, that the killing of us would not cost him a thought.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">We were well secured with iron chains on our feet, and were never permitted to go
                              far from the house. We could never fall upon plans for effecting our escape, although
                              we often tried different means for that purpose. One night I managed to get the chains
                              off my feet, and would have escaped had not the fear of being recaptured prevented
                              me. Notwithstanding all the plans which Medina resorted to, she could not get the
                              chains off her feet. A short time after this, a caravan (consisting of merchants and
                              travellers) left the village of Tegla. With this caravan our master joined, and, after
                              a day's journey, we arrived at a small village, where he was disappointed in his object,
                              viz., the disposing of us into another's hands, therefore he had no other recourse
                              but to return to his own country. Arriving at the village, we received the heart-rending
                              intelligence that our friends had been in search of us, and were frustrated, having
                              heard that we were taken to a distant land. Another caravan was soon
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">20</span>
                              equipped for a farther distance. This was some four day's journey from the village
                              of Tegla, to a large town called Kordofan, under the jurisdiction of the Pacha of
                              Egypt. The first night we pitched our tents at a well of water, not having seen a
                              single house on the whole of our journey. The second day we continued our journey
                              till late at night, when we received the guidance of some light from a distant village,
                              where we arrived and reposed ourselves. This village was called by the natives Albaharr,
                              or, as seen on our maps, Albeit. The inhabitants are a people who might be distinguished
                              among a thousand different nations. Such is their love of jewellery, that they wear
                              rings on their nostrils as well as ears. Instead of horses, or donkeys, or camels,
                              they ride upon bullocks, the noses of which are also adorned with rings, and to these
                              the bridles are tied. We stayed a few days at this place, and shared the unfeigned
                              hospitality of the people, who were uncommonly kind. During our stay here, Medina
                              and I were taken to the camp of the Turks, not far away from the village, where we
                              were put through different exercises. The first thing we were desired to do was to
                              show our tongues, and then our teeth. The rest of our limbs underwent a serious examination
                              also. Having undergone this examination, we were taken back to our lodgings again.
                              The next day our master joined the Turks, who were returning to Kordofan, and by that
                              means ensured our fate of never returning to our native country. In two days we
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">21</span>
                              reached the point of our destination, and there our master disposed of us to an Arab,
                              with whom we lived but two or three days. From an Arab we fell into the hands of a
                              Turk. My time while with the first three masters was employed doing nothing. The Turkish
                              gentleman found work for every body; and all the testimony I can bear to his good
                              character is, that he was one of the cruelest men in existence.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">Being an officer of the rank of an aga, his men suffered many harsh cruelties under
                              him. On one occasion, a soldier having been brought to his house for a small offence,
                              he took the office of corporal; and commanding four men to hold him down, beat the
                              poor man, till the blood was running from his cheeks. The keeper of his camels often
                              suffered in a similar way. My office was what might be called a general house-servant.
                              The duties of waiting the table, washing dishes, making coffee, and waiting for orders,
                              were allotted to me as my share of the work. Medina was made assistant cook for a
                              short time, but I had the disagreeable misfortune to see her sold to another Turk;
                              thus I was left to suffer alone.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">Some six months, however, relieved me of my hardships. To mention all the cruelties
                              I suffered at that time, would be quite needless. I will only notify a few of them.
                              My master, on whom I had continually to attend, punished every small fault with great
                              severity. If he called, he said I ought to hear him at whatever distance I might be.
                              At one time, being sent from home by my
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">22</span>
                              mistress, my master interrogated me on my return with where have you been, and began
                              to thrash me. Self-justification was of no use. No moderate blows did with him, for
                              while he struck one side of my head, he met it at the other side also. I became almost
                              insensible, while the blood was running out of my ears. At another time, having made
                              some coffee by his own orders, I happened to make a few cups more than was required.
                              He said nothing at the time; but after I was in bed, he got hold of a horse whip,
                              and coming upon me unawares, thrashed me till I was quite speechless. I am persuaded
                              he would have killed me had not one of the domestics heard my cries, and come to my
                              rescue. Here I may mention that a very small child can stop a Mahomedan from revenging
                              himself to too great an extent, by taking the whip, or whatever he uses, from him.
                              One of the slaves was the means of preventing my master from whipping me any longer.
                              In Kordofan the houses are all of one storey high. The part in which I lived was chiefly
                              occupied by officers in the Pacha's service. My master was married, had two children,
                              two female slaves, two males, and myself. The other two being grown-up men, were taken
                              out to exercise along with the rest of the soldiers. When coming home from exercise,
                              my master was sure to be heard crying my name a quarter of a mile's distance from
                              the house, at which I had to run out to meet him and carry his sword home. These,
                              and other sufferings of the like nature,
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">23</span>
                              prepared me for my subsequent career, and fitted me for the journey on the desert.
                              The circumstances which relieved me of my present master were as singular as the many
                              unlooked-for whippings I received. One evening, when the sun was going down, and everything
                              assuming the quietude of an eastern calm, a certain Arab came to our house, with whom
                              I was desired to go and fetch some soap. I left everything behind me, and went on
                              my supposed errand. Having arrived at the man's house, he asked my name, and told
                              me that I was his property. I merely answered his reply by a look, for ere this time
                              I had become quite regardless of my fate. My new master, whose name was Jubalee, was
                              a native of Dongola, and had come to Kordofan on a trading excursion. He was in company
                              with two others of the names of Auchmet and Mahomet from the same town. Mahomet, the
                              youngest of the two, was a cruel monster, torturing and beating the slaves without
                              any occasion. Auchmet was moderate. My master was of a quiet resigned temper, unless
                              too much interfered with, and very seldom whipped any of his slaves. Having gathered
                              six of us, they now thought of starting for their native country; and to this effect
                              preparations were soon made. They procured four camels, a horse, and other necessaries
                              for travelling, and started, shaping their course to the banks of the Nile. Travelling
                              in these eastern countries is attended with many perilous situations, those engaged
                              in it being exposed to

                           <p class="p  ">Our journey (before reaching the banks of the Nile) occupied ten days. Many were the
                              privations we suffered on our way, sometimes from the excessive heat of the sun, and
                              sometimes from want of water. During the middle of the day, we were so much overpowered
                              by the heat, that we often had to delay our journey. At another time we had to exist
                              a whole day without water, under the following circumstances: The water camel, of
                              which I had a particular charge, was going before all the rest, and, unfortunately
                              came, upon a dead camel lying on the road. The sight and smell of this animal soon
                              spirit-stirred it, and the result was, that it danced and ran through thick and thin
                              till the water bags, which were hanging on each side of the saddle, were destroyed,
                              having come in contact with some wood on the side of the saddle. Fortune, however,
                              had not altogether turned her face from us, for, in the evening, we came to some wells,
                              where we supplied ourselves and rested for the night. From this place we pursued our
                              journey to the banks of the Nile, and pitched our tents in the valley of Senaar, only
                              a short distance from the town. My master left me here with the old man, two
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">25</span>
                              of the slaves, and a camel. Taking with him Mahomet, and the rest of the travelling
                              appendages, he went to the town of Senaar, and there stayed for about a fortnight.
                              During the whole of my time here, I had very little to occupy me, so I ran about through
                              the different places without the least danger of meeting with a second kidnap. The
                              vale at that time was in its prime, the trees having on their coats of variegated
                              green; the grass, the herbs, and flowers, in full bloom; in short, everything was
                              so beautiful, that nature seemed to contradict the wickedness of the world. Happening
                              one day to go to the river side, I observed something uncommon moving on the water,
                              with some white sheets filled with wind, as I thought. I had a dish in which I intended
                              to have carried some water home, but on seeing this curious spectacle approaching
                              me, I took to my heels, and leaving the dish behind, presented myself almost breathless
                              before the old man. On explaining to him the appearance of the sight I had seen, he
                              reprimanded my silliness, and told me that it was a ship, assuring me that it would
                              injure no person, provided the people on board kept quiet, so I went back for my dish.
                              This was the first time I ever saw a ship. My master arriving from Senaar soon after,
                              we started, with an additional number of merchants from the town, and proceeded to
                              Dongola. These merchants were not possessed of slaves, but had a great number of camels,
                              and horses, and donkeys, thus making a

                              formidable caravan. For three or four days we shaped our course along the banks of
                              the Nile, under the direction of one of the native Arabs. At the end of that time,
                              we prepared for a journey on the Libyan desert.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">Our Arab guide now left us to pilot ourselves, and returned home. I was entirely deprived
                              of a ride on any of the camels, being engaged in leading my old friend, the water
                              camel, which was now turned into an hospital. One of the female slaves having grown
                              ill with a mortal swelling in her thigh, could not walk, and, in consequence, I had
                              to lead the camel on which she rode for nearly a month while crossing the desert.
                              She grew worse and worse every day till she died, and was buried in the sand, without
                              coffin or anything, while her death was not commemorated by the shedding of a single
                              tear. Such are the horrors of the slave trade. Well do I remember the evening of her
                              death. The sun was going down, the azure sky appeared to witness the end with calmness
                              and composure, while the surrounding aspect threw a deep gloom over all our proceedings.
                              I was thrown far behind the rest of the travellers; my fellow companion in slavery
                              began to totter on her saddle, and death was soon announced by her falling from the
                              camel. She was a native of Durfur,—a woman in the zenith of her life. The death of
                              this unfortunate female put me in permanent possession of the camel during the remainder
                              of the journey. By this time I became a great favourite with my master; and on one
                              occasion
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">27</span>
                              he broke his walking cane over the back of one of the slaves on account of having
                              taken the chief seat on my camel from me. Constrained by sorrow afterwards, my master
                              desired me not to tell how his cane was broken. From the tediousness of our journey,
                              we were glad to see Old Dongola, which predicted our nearness to the point of our
                              destination. This town is situate on the banks of the Nile, and is distinguished for
                              its ruins. We stayed here a short time to recruit our strength, and then proceeded
                              to New Dongola, along the river's banks. A few days saw us home, and on our arrival,
                              the different masters separated, each taking a share of the spoil with him. Auchmet,
                              the eldest, took two of the slaves and a camel; Jubalee took for his share three of
                              the slaves—one having died in the desert; and Mahomet took the rest of the live stock.
                              I was only a few days with my master at his home when I was purchased by Mahomet's
                              father. Mahomet's father and mother were two aged persons, and wished me to be a companion
                              to them while their son followed his occupation. But their next door neighbour having
                              expressed a desire for me to keep his shop, I was accordingly sold to him. I did not
                              like my new master so well as the two former ones,—he often behaving cruelly to his
                              slaves. I was generally very fortunate in keeping out of the many whippings which
                              the rest received. On taking me to his house, he gave me some meat, and immediately
                              after took me to his shop, about half a

                              mile from the house. He was a dealer in all sorts of spices and gums,—the produce
                              of the country. His shop was in one of the Dongola arcades, and was situated between
                              a doctor's and a jeweller's. Besides myself, another young man, of the name of Salama,
                              graced the shop door. Salama and I became great friends, and often went together to
                              play by the water side. After the shop was shut one evening, we traced our steps,
                              as usual, to the river's side, but what was my singular astonishment on perceiving
                              a female at a distance whom I thought I knew. On going up to her, whom should I see
                              but my old friend, Medina. Salama stood quite astonished when he heard her call me
                              her brother. A small explanation, however, soon settled him. Medina took us to her
                              master's house, and introduced us to her fellows, but our time being limited, we had
                              to leave and get home as quick as possible, promising to return and see them again.
                              This was a thing which we never accomplished while together, for Salama was sold soon
                              after. A few days after this event, Salama and I happened to fall in with a pistol
                              and some powder in the shop. Curiosity induced us to load it. Being the first time
                              I had examined a pistol closely, I desired Salama to fire. He went to the window,
                              and putting the mouth of it out to the open air, fired it off, and loaded it again,
                              asking me to fire it off next. Instead of using the same precautions as he did, I
                              fired it off in the shop, which caused a great smell of powder in the arcade. This
                              induced

                              the neighbours to investigate every place closely, who found that the greatest smell
                              proceeded from our shop. They accordingly took hold of Salama, and would have thrashed
                              him had he not put the blame upon me. I now took to my heels and ran for it, but my
                              limbs were not sufficient to escape so many pursuers in the arcade; in consequence
                              I was captured, and received such a thrashing as I did not forget in a very short
                              time. Luckily our master was away from the shop at the time of this occurrence. Contrary
                              to our expectations, he only gave a laugh when he was informed of our conduct. Soon
                              after our master found out that it was not adequate to keep two of us in the shop,
                              and accordingly sold my friend, Salama. I was now obliged to deal alone among the
                              spices. I made out to pay another visit to Medina, who always gave me a kind reception,
                              and had a little more time to relate our respective histories. I found that I was
                              with my seventh master, whilst she was only with her fifth. Our time being so uncertain,
                              we always bid each other good bye for ever, and it proved so on this occasion. Two
                              or three days after, my master brought a man to the shop, who carefully scrutinized
                              me after the manner of the slave traders, and then I was desired to follow him as
                              my future owner.

                              race of people, who addict themselves chiefly to agricultural interests. Hemet Hether
                              took me by the hand and led me through the streets of Dongola to the suburbs of the
                              town. We arrived at his brother's house, situate a few miles out of town, where two
                              of his sons were waiting to receive us. I was put into a room where two other slaves
                              were sitting, and with them I soon entered into conversation. The one was a boy the
                              other a girl; the former from Durfur, the latter from Senaar. Our master was merely
                              staying at his brother's for the purpose of gathering slaves, as his home was nearly
                              a month's journey from Dongola, on the way to Cairo, a small village, called by the
                              natives Goortie. Having gathered three of us, he and his sons now thought of going
                              home, and began to prepare accordingly. We started on a morning when the sun was shining
                              on the green fields of corn with bright illumination, and marched along till we found
                              ourselves in a desert country. Before I left Dongola, my old master, Jubalee (having
                              heard that a travelling merchant had bought me), came and gave my character as being
                              an excellent traveller, and mentioned several incidents to ratify that belief on my
                              present master's mind. For this reason I was entrusted with one of the camels. After
                              going through the usual difficulties

                              my master received on this occasion were indescribable. His wife kissing him, with
                              tears of joy in her eyes, his daughter clinging to his neck, and the neighbours shaking
                              hands with him, all showed friendship in the superlative degree.

                              employed in doing sundry things. First of all, I was sent to live with a friend of
                              my master's, who behaved very kindly to me. Here I had to take care of some cows,
                              while the man's two sons attended to the lands of the farm, which were between three
                              and four miles from the house. About six miles from Goortie, my master married a young
                              woman, with whom I was soon taken to live. In many of the eastern countries, and particularly
                              Egypt, a man is not confined to one wife, but can keep as many as his abilities will
                              allow him. My master's recent marriage was the cause of raising a deal of jealousy
                              on the part of the old one. He chiefly resided at the house he had built for the former,
                              and when the latter met

                              him they were sure to quarrel about something or other. On one occasion, being sent
                              with some corn to the old lady's, on a donkey's back, she would not allow me to empty
                              the sacks, so I had to stand for about half a day to await my master's arrival. On
                              his coming up to me, he asked me why I did not empty the sacks? I told him my reason;
                              after which he went into the house, and a quarrel ensued. The neighbours gathered
                              about the house, and tried to prevent the quarrel; but, my master being in a passion,
                              they found great difficulty in getting him quieted. After he had broken a great number
                              of things, they managed to get him out of the house, and I obtained liberty to empty
                              my sacks and return home. My master also returned to his new wife's, and never went
                              back to Goortie, till within a few days of leaving for Cairo. The slave-ship landed
                              in its season at Goortie, and took us on board. We arrived at the first cataracts
                              of the Nile, and it being impracticable for the ship to proceed farther, we had to
                              change our quarters. The masters busied themselves looking out for another ship to
                              contain their menagerie of human beings. For this purpose we had to travel by land,
                              and finally to sleep on land, before embarking again. Our new ship was a small one,
                              and could not contain all our luggage without a crush; in <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: consequence">consesequence</span>, some of the slaves sickened, and were paid for their trouble by receiving a good
                              flogging. After a fortnight had elapsed, we landed within a few miles of Cairo, in
                              order to make ourselves
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">34</span>
                              look as fresh as daisies before entering the city. From this place we were made to
                              march in military order. The grown up slaves led the van, and I, along with other
                              young ones, marched in the rear, while our masters kept on the flanks. On reaching
                              the entrance to the royal city, we were all counted by a man appointed for that purpose,
                              who found that there were forty of us and ten masters. As soon as the counting was
                              over, each master took his slaves and separated. Our master took us to an acquaintance
                              of his, where he disposed of us, one after the other, but not before two months elapsed.
                              We were regularly taken and exhibited in the slave market, where purchasers came to
                              pick and choose. The grown up ones soon went off, while the small live stock remained
                              for a long time in the market. A month after, my master shifted to another part of
                              the town, a place near the barracks of Cairo. Here there were several of his countrymen,
                              (under the employ of the Pacha,) whose duty it was to keep the gate of a manufactory
                              of sundry wares. In this place he left me, and went away, but where I could not tell.
                              A week or ten days after he returned for me, and took me to my old quarter, the slave
                              market, where he soon disposed of me. My ninth master was a European gentleman, of
                              the name of P——. With Mr. P—— I only lived a fortnight, when I was dispatched (under
                              charge of a Turk) down to Alexandria. The next master into whose hands I fell was
                              R—— T——, Esq., British Consul in Egypt. Having fallen
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">35</span>
                              into the hands of a British gentleman, I now thought that I was lost, having heard
                              so many Mahommedan prejudices against Christians. Contrary to my expectation, however,
                              I was treated with the greatest clemency, received many indulgences which I never
                              met with before, and what completed my happiness was the pains which Mr. L——, my master's
                              son-in-law, took in learning me to read and write. When he found it impossible to
                              teach me himself, the duty devolved upon Mrs. S——, the housekeeper. I found much gratification
                              in this novel treatment, and expected to know great things by it. Mrs. L., who took
                              great charge of me, never failed in seeing that I was comfortable. While all the African
                              formalities were exchanging for European fashions, four months elapsed, after which
                              the family sailed up the Nile to the first cataracts, taking me, and Mrs. S——, and
                              an Italian servant, of the name of Jacquomo. The first cataracts are about 400 miles
                              from Alexandria. A whole month was spent in going and coming back from the cataracts;
                              and the objects which occupied the particular attention of the family were the ancient
                              buildings then standing in ruins. On the left bank of the Nile, and at some distance
                              from Cairo, the Egyptian pyramids present a huge spectacle, having the appearance
                              of small hills. These and many other edifices were built in the distant ages of antiquity,
                              when the Egyptian monarchy flourished under its native dynasty. It is now a country
                              ruled by a despotic viceroy.
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">36</span>
                              The native Egyptians are a quiet, inoffensive people, rather darker than the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: descendants">decendants</span> of Ishmael, and still devote their time to learning, not seeming to have forgot the
                              noble propensities of their ancestors. Architecture had been carried to its highest
                              eminence by the Egyptians three thousand years before the Christian era. The ruins
                              are scattered throughout the whole country. There are several old ruins at the cataracts,
                              and these, along with the waterfalls, form the most romantic scenery imaginable. On
                              our way home, the family visited Thebes and other places of antiquity. Arriving at
                              Alexandria, my master, along with Mr. and Mrs. L., soon prepared for another journey.
                              Taking Mr. and Mrs. S—— with them, they took the steamer to Malta. This was the first
                              steam-boat I ever had been in, and was curious to know how the vessel went without
                              sails. I asked one of the sailors, who explained the whole mystery by telling me that
                              it went upon wheels. Five days and five nights on the Mediterranean brought us to
                              Malta—a beautiful island, under the British Government. During our quarantine at Lazarett,
                              my master sent Mr. and Mrs. S—— by a vessel bound for England, while we were confined
                              for three weeks at this place previous to our entering the town. No foreigner is allowed
                              to go to the town of Malta without riding quarantine for a certain length of time.
                              Our time elapsing in this place of confinement, the family went to the town, stayed
                              a short time there, and then set sail for Messina, in Sicily,
                              
                              
                              	<span class="pb-title">37</span>
                              but the sea grew so boisterous that the vessel (which was but a small one) had to
                              return to Malta again. I had fallen asleep during the night, and was not aware of
                              our return till morning. When I went on deck I learned that the family had gone ashore
                              during the night, while the sailors, who were all Maltese, told me that they were
                              desired to remunerate their toils by appropriating me to themselves. I began to cry,
                              and and could not be pacified till they assured me to the contrary. They gave me some
                              breakfast, and two of them (who had received previous instructions) took me to my
                              master.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">In a short time after, we again set out to Messina in a larger ship; and, after two
                              days sail, arrived safe at the long-looked-for place. At Messina my master's nephew
                              (Mr. H—— T——) awaited our arrival, and took us to his house. Here we stayed for sometime,
                              and then went to Naples, where my master left Mr. and Mrs. L——, and proceeded to England.
                              Having left Naples in the evening, the Italian steamer sailed the whole night; and
                              next day, by twelve o'clock, landed us at Leghorn, and there we had to fork for our
                              dinner on shore. Although we were taken on board upon condition of getting everything,
                              they played us the same trick at two other places. When the vessel arrived at Genoa,
                              my master betook himself to inland travelling, wishing to cross the continent, and
                              sail over the channel to England. In pursuance of this scheme, he got a carriage from

                              Genoa to Milan. In the suburbs of Milan my master was met by Mr. J—, another son-in-law.
                              After staying a short time here, we left for England. Mr. J. also left his family
                              and accompanied my master. We traversed the continent, and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: permanently">parmanently</span> crossed the channel from Rotterdam to London.

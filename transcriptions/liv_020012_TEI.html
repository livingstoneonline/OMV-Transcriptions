                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"<span class="">Chumah</span> and <span class="">Susi</span> have been on board to see me this morning, and <span class="">Chumah</span> asked me to write a letter to you for him, and I send you what he dictated. '<span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span> died at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ulala</span>, near the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">S.W. bend of <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake Bangweolo</span></span> on the <span class="">30th of April</span>.

Their existence is affirmed, <span class="">Chumah</span> tells me, by all the people they met around <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Lake Bangweolo</span>."
                     </p> 
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Here is <span class="">Chumah</span>'s letter:—
                     </p> 
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">"<span class="">Chumah</span> gives compliments to <span class="">Mr. Waller</span>. I have been all over with <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span> in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>, and am now in <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> with my wife. I am now by myself. I do not know what work to do. Give compliments
                        to my sister, who is at the <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">Cape</span>. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Her">His</span> name <span class="">Chaika</span>. I hear it with <span class="">Dr.  Livingstone</span> that letters came to him that <span class="">Kinsolo</span>, my brother, been shot with a gun. I don't know who shoot him. If please you get
                        answer, send to me at <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span>. <span class="">Susi</span>, <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Kibanga man</span>, give <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: his">him</span> compliments to <span class="">Mr. Waller</span> and to <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span>'s son, and now he is in <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> and will wait for a letter. If you have got any business in <span class="bloc" title="A multinational entity, usually a continent.">Africa</span>, let us know.

                     <p class="p  ">I will merely add that on starting upon this last fatal journey in <span class="">1866</span>, <span class="">Chumah</span>, then a lad of about 14 years, promised me in a similar epistle that he would stick
                        to the <span class="">Doctor</span>, come what might. He has kept his word. In speaking of <span class="">Chinsoro</span> and <span class="">Chasika</span>, he uses the native idiom ; they were not blood relatives. <span class="">Chinsoro</span> was murdered some years since under circumstances so brutal that I can understand
                        <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span> in suppressing the details in mentioning the fact to him. <span class="">Chasika</span>, <span class="">Chinsoro</span>'s widow, is very poorly off at <span class="region" title="A formally-named region.">the Cape</span>. Both, in company with <span class="">Chumah</span>, were originally liberated by us from the slavers.  <span class="">Chumah</span>'s wife seems a new acquisition.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Thanks to the heroic conduct of these men an enormous mass of geographlcal information
                        is now in the possession of <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span>'s family. In common with others I have received very long communications from him
                        which I will not touch on now beyond stating that there is continual evidence in them
                        that at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ujiji</span>, at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyanyembe</span>—in short, at every point between the coast and <span class="">Dr. Livingstone</span>'s  exploring ground, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span> were fully aware how suicidal it was to allow him to correspond with the outer world.
                        It was, in fact, death to be caught taking letters on his behalf. Wise in their generation,
                        they knew the slave trade was crumbling to pieces under the fierce glance of his observations.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Would that the tried spirit could have known what we knew before it passed away to
                        its rest ! Instead of the annual 20,000 slaves being imported into <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> in <span class="">1873</span>, thence to be dispersed on the four winds of bondage, we reduced the number by recent
                        active exertions to a total export of 1,400 only, thus mightily had he dealt his blows,
                        not in the dark, but in total ignorance of all the interest excited by his revelations
                        and the measures taken in consequence of his former letters. Alas, that we must thus
                        speak in the past tense !
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p class="p  ">Already in <span class="">1874</span> the tide is turned. Law officers stand in the stead of him who is no more. The slave
                        trade is reviving hand over hand, and, with shame and indignation, we are forced to
                        admit that such men as <span class="">Livingstone</span> may come and go, but red tape flows on for ever.

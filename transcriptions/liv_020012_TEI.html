                           to the <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Doctor</span>, come what might. He has kept his word. In speaking of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chinsoro</span> and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chasika</span>, he uses the native idiom ; they were not blood relatives. <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Chinsoro</span> was murdered some years since under circumstances so brutal that I can understand

                           which I will not touch on now beyond stating that there is continual evidence in them
                           that at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Ujiji</span>, at <span class="settlement" title="A settlement, such as a state, city, town, or village.">Unyanyembe</span>—in short, at every point between the coast and <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Dr. Livingstone</span>'s  exploring ground, the <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Arabs</span> were fully aware how suicidal it was to allow him to correspond with the outer world.
                           It was, in fact, death to be caught taking letters on his behalf. Wise in their generation,
                           they knew the slave trade was crumbling to pieces under the fierce glance of his observations.

                           its rest ! Instead of the annual 20,000 slaves being imported into <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Zanzibar</span> in <span class="">1873</span>, thence to be dispersed on the four winds of bondage, we reduced the number by recent
                           active exertions to a total export of 1,400 only, thus mightily had he dealt his blows,
                           not in the dark, but in total ignorance of all the interest excited by his revelations
                           and the measures taken in consequence of his former letters. Alas, that we must thus

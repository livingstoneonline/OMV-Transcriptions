<p>Two letters addressed to an <term type="collective">English</term> merchant, by <persName>Selim Aga</persName>, a native of <country>Darfur</country>, in <bloc>Central Africa</bloc>, who is engaged in the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName> expedition, have been forwarded for publication to the <hi rend="italic">Carlisle Journal</hi>. When the writer was ten years of age, he was purchased in <country>Egypt</country> by the gentleman to whom the letters are addressed, and he subsequently received an excellent <term type="collective">English</term> education. <persName>Selim</persName> is now upwards of 30 years of age, and is able to render important aid to the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName> expedition. The following are extracts from the letters :&#8212;</p>
<p><placeName>Lagos</placeName>, <bloc>West Africa</bloc>, <date when="1858-06-24">June 24, 1858</date>.&#8212;I am now with <persName>Lieutenant Glover</persName>, getting provisions and other necessaries for our expedition into the interior of <bloc>Africa</bloc>. We intend to proceed up <geogName type="river">the river</geogName> <!-- The Niger River --> in the <hi rend="italic">Spero Meliora</hi>, and to commence our land journey from <placeName>Rabbah</placeName> to <placeName>Kanoo</placeName> in <placeName>Housa</placeName>, thence to <placeName>Kirka</placeName>, in <placeName>Bornou</placeName>, and thence to <placeName>Begharmi</placeName>, <placeName>Wadai</placeName>, and the <geogName type="mountain">Mountains of the Moon</geogName>, to the source of the <geogName type="river">Nile</geogName>, thence through <country>Darfur</country>, <placeName>Kordofan</placeName>, <placeName>Senaar</placeName>, <placeName>Nubia</placeName>, and <country>Egypt</country>, to <country>England</country>. I think we may be about 18 months <!-- Adrian should this be date coded for Dec 1859 since we have the letter date? HB --> before reaching <country>England</country>. l am glad to hear that <persName>Mr. Laird</persName> intends to send many more steamboats to the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName>, and have not the least doubt that the outlay will be covered in about a couple of years; and under the management of sensible men the trade of the country will increase annually nearly a hundred fold, till every patch of useless ground is under cultivation. To provide this let us look at the <term type="plant">cotton</term> trade at <placeName>Abeokuta</placeName>. It has been established under the auspices of the <orgName><settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement> Chamber of Commerce</orgName>, and is immediately patronised by the <orgName>Church Missionary Society</orgName>, because that society is now anxious that it should encourage free labour produce, and give up consuming <term type="collective">American</term> slave-grown <!-- Adrian, are we still tagging all thingsslave-related like this? HB --> <term type="plant">cotton</term>. A lay agent has been sent to <placeName>Abeokuta</placeName> with all the necessaries for cleaning and pressing <term type="plant">cotton</term>. The first twelve months he managed to send about 300 bales, but the second year, which ended in <date when="1857-05">last May</date>, realised something like 1,000, nearly an increase of 250 per cent.; and <persName>Mr. Robin</persName>, the agent, a native of the <country>country</country> <!-- England (?) -->, is now obliged to commence business at four or five o'clock in the morning in order to get rid of his customers by six o'clock in the evening. Encouraged by this fact, merchants are about to establish themselves at <placeName>Abeokuta</placeName>, thus giving every encouragement to the natives of this populous town and surrounding country. Rabbah, although at present a complete ruin, will be one of the greatest commercial emporiums on the banks of the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName>; for, independent of its position as a marine port, it possesses great interest from the fact of its being the great medium of communication to <placeName>Kuka</placeName>, <placeName>Kanoo</placeName>, and the lake <geogName type="lake">Tchad</geogName>. The last caravan we met from those localities numbered about 2,000 travellers, with upwards of 600 or 700 <term type="animal">horses</term> and <term type="animal">donkeys</term>. They bring ivory, guns, and hides from the interior to <placeName>Ilorin</placeName>, and receive in return <term type="collective">European</term> goods and clothing, with which they return back to their own country. Therefore, a clever merchant established at <placeName>Rabbah</placeName> would intercept all the trade of the interior, besides the goods which will be supplied by the <term type="collective"><placeName>Tappah</placeName> and <placeName>Nufeh</placeName> people</term>. There is, however, one great want at Rabbah, <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice>, a judicial officer in the capacity of consul or magistrate. If such an authority could be sent out from <country>England</country> (and he must be a white man), it would induce many emigrants from <placeName>Sierra</placeName> to settle on the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName>, thus facilitating the labours of the missionary and the merchant; for, once perfectly satisfied that the general laws of <country>England</country> are extending their benign influence into this part of <bloc>Africa</bloc>, every educated <term type="collective">African</term> who is a native of the river <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName> will venture, with his life and property, to settle on <geogName type="river">that river</geogName> <!-- Niger -->. With regard to the trade of the <country>country</country> <!-- England (?) -->, I think there is every facility for a very extensive business as far as the natives are concerned, but the question of sending the <term type="foodstuff">produce</term> to the mouth of <geogName type="river">the river</geogName> or any other part for shipment is rather a difficult matter, for the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName> is not always sufficiently full to allow for communication by means of steamboats. A question, therefore arises as to whether it would be more profitable for the merchant to store up his goods for the space of six months (the dry season), or to start a quadruped communication from <placeName>Rabbah</placeName> to <placeName>Lagos</placeName>. The latter is practicable, only it would entail an immense expense at the onset. The distance is about 400 miles, and I have now travelled the road three times, twice with <persName><choice><abbr>Lieut</abbr><expan>Lieutenant</expan></choice>. Glover</persName> and once a part of the way by myself, in charge of <orgName>government</orgName> <!-- British --> stores for the <geogName type="river">Niger</geogName> camp. The stores consisted of 15 loads; a load weighs from 45 to 60 pounds on an average, and is carried on the head of the bearer; each bearer is paid at the rate of 1,000 cowries per day, or 1s. 3d. sterling <!-- Adrian, not sure what D stands for to expand? HB -->, thus making in 15 days (the period occupied in travelling with loads from <placeName>Rabbah</placeName> to <country>Lagos</country>), the sum of 18s. 9d. per load. Now, will it pay to employ a bearer to bring a tusk weighing 501bs., and which costs from £5 to £6 at <placeName>Rabbah</placeName>, for shipment at <country>Lagos</country>? I think it will. Besides this, a number of <term type="animal">horses</term> or <term type="animal">donkeys</term> might be stationed in the different chief towns on the road, and thus reduce the period of transmit from fifteen to eight or nine days. The price of a <term type="animal">donkey</term> in the <placeName>Housa country</placeName> would not be more than 15 shillings, and if a number of young men were redeemed from slavery and put under the superintendence of a partially educated person at the different stations, they could be employed partly in taking charge of the <term type="foodstuff">produce</term> whilst on its way to the next station, partly in cultivating a sufficient amount of ground for the growth of <term type="plant_foodstuff">yams</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term>, and other necessaries for the support of themselves and the <term type="animal">beasts of burden</term> under their charge. Land can be had for nothing, and negotiations can be entered into with different kings and chiefs along the road for perfect freedom to pass with the goods. They (the chiefs) are a great nuisance, for they stopped me at one place (<placeName>Obomishaw</placeName>) demanding 40 cowries for every one of the 15 loads under my charge. I protested against this piece of insolence, threatening the chiefs, with the white man's guns, and succeeded in getting away scot free. The next time I came through the same town with six loads, the chiefs and their men retreated into the town, leaving the gate entirely at my disposal. Not to abandon the subject of trade, however, it may be as well to mention that the price of a slave in the <placeName>Yariba country</placeName> is from £7 to £11. The free natives will not work for us, and <term type="collective"><placeName>Kroo</placeName> boys</term> are too lazy, although to be had at a very low price, <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice>, from 10s. to 17s. a month; but they scarcely pay for their keep, so that the choice of <unclear>Hobson</unclear> <!-- Not sure if name or place? HB --> is left to the man of enterprise&#8212;that is, to purchase slaves for domestic and other purposes till a better remedy is found out.</p>

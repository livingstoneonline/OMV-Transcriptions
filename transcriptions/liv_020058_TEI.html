                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p  ">This list can be extended to double this number of villages, and in every case there
                              has been 
                              a great decrease in the population.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This has been, to a very great extent, caused by the extreme 
                              measures resorted to by officers of the State, and the freedom enjoyed by the soldiers
                              to do just 
                              as they pleased.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are more people in the district near the villages mentioned, but they are 
                              hidden away in the bush like hunted animals, with only a few branches thrown together
                              for 
                              shelter, for they have no trust that the present quiet state of things will continue,
                              and they have 
                              no heart to build houses or make good gardens.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In all the villages mentioned there are very few 
                              good huts, and when the natives are urged to make better houses for the sake of their
                              health, 
                              the reply is, that there is no advantage to them in building good houses or making
                              extensive 
                              gardens, as these would only give the State a greater hold upon them and lead to more
                              exorbitant 
                              demands.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The decrease has several causes:—
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">1.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O* was deserted because of demands made for rubber by M.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>N O and several others 
                              were similar cases.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The natives went to the French territory.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">2.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“War,”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in which children and women were killed as well as men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Women and children 
                              were killed not in all cases by stray bullets, but were taken as prisoners and killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sad to 
                              say, these horrible cases were not always the acts of some black soldier.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Proof was laid 
                              against one officer who shot one woman and one man, while they were before him as
                              prisoners 
                              with their hands tied, and no attempt was made by the accused to deny the truth of
                              the 
                              statement.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To those killed in the so-called “war”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>must be added large numbers of those 
                              
                              <span class="pb-title">0071</span>

                              who died while kept as prisoners of war.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Others were carried to far distant camps and have 
                              never returned.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many of the young were sent to Missions, and the death-rate was enormous.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              Here is one example:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ten children were sent from a State steamer to a Mission, and in spite 
                              of comfortable surroundings there were only three alive at the end of a month.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The others had 
                              died of dysentery and bowel troubles contracted during the voyage.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two more struggled on for 
                              about fifteen months, but never recovered strength, and at last died.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In less than two years only 
                              one of the ten was alive.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">3.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another cause of the decrease is that the natives are weakened in body through insufficient
                              
                              and irregular food supply.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They cannot resist disease as of old.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In spite of assurances that 
                              the old state of things will not come again, the native refuses to build good houses,
                              make 
                              large gardens, and make the best of the new surroundings—he is without ambition because
                              
                              without hope, and when sickness comes he does not seem to care.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">4.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Again a lower percentage of births lessen the population.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Weakened bodies is one cause 
                              of this.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another reason is that women refuse to bear children, and take means to save themselves
                              
                              from motherhood.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They give as the reason that if “war”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>should come a woman “big with 
                              child,”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>or with a baby to carry, cannot well run away and hide from the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Confidence will 
                              no doubt, be restored, but it grows but slowly.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">There are two points in connection with the “war”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(so-called):—
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">(1.) The cause.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              (2.) The manner in which it was conducted.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">(1.) The natives never had obeyed any other man than their own Chiefs.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Leopold II 
                              became their King they were not aware of the fact, nor had they any hand in the making
                              of the 
                              new arrangement.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Demands were made on them, and they did not understand why they 
                              should obey the stranger.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the demands were not excessive, but others were simply 
                              impossible.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From the G H* people and the O* group of towns large demands of rubber 
                              were made.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There was not much within their reach, and it was a dangerous thing to be a 
                              stranger in a strange part of the forests.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The O* people offered to pay a monthly tribute of 
                              goats, fowls, &amp;c., but M.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>N O would have rubber, so they left.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The G H* had to bear the 
                              scourge of war frequently and many were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now they supply what they probably would 
                              have supplied without the loss of one person, kwanga and fresh meats, and roofing
                              materials and 
                              mats.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rubber was demanded from some others and war resulted.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are now providing 
                              the State with fish and fowls.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">Another fertile source of war lay in the actions of the native soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Generally speaking 
                              their statements against other natives were received as truth that needed no support.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take the 
                              following as an example:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One morning it was reported that State soldiers had shot several 
                              people near the channel leading from H K* to the Congo.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several canoes full of manioc had 
                              been also seized, and the friends of the dead and owners of two of the canoes asked
                              that they 
                              might have the canoes and food, and that they might take the bodies and bury them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But 
                              this was refused.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was alleged the people were shot in the act of deserting from the State into 
                              French territory.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chief who was shot was actually returning from having gone with a 
                              message from M.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O P to a village, and was killed east of the camp and of his home, while 
                              “France”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lay to the west.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers said that the people had been challenged to stop and 
                              that they refused, and that they had been shot as they paddled away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But really they had 
                              landed when called by the soldiers; they had been tied hand and foot, and then shot.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One 
                              woman had struggled when shot, and had broken the vines with which her feet were tied,
                              and 
                              she, though wounded, tried to escape.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second bullet made her fall, but yet she rose and ran 
                              a few steps, when a third bullet laid her low.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their hands had all been taken off—i.e., the 
                              right hand of each—for evidence of the faithfulness of the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>M.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O P shot two of the 
                              soldiers, but the leader of the party was not shot, though the whole matter was carried
                              through 
                              by him, and he it was that gave M.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O P the false report.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">A Chief complained that certain soldiers had taken his wives and had stolen all of
                              his 
                              belongings that they cared to have.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He made no complaint against the “tax”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that the soldiers 
                              had gone there to secure, but told of the cruelty and oppression of the soldiers carried
                              on for 
                              their own gain.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white officer kicked him off the verandah and said that he told many lies.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              The Chief turned round with fury written on his face, stood silently looking at the
                              white 
                              man, and then stalked off; two days later there was a report that all the soldiers
                              with their 
                              wives and followers had been killed in that Chief’s town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A little later the white officer who

                              one soldier was killed, and they killed one K K* man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the white man said let us go 
                              home, and they went home, and then we, too, came out of the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was the first fight.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

                              us into the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers came into the bush near us they were calling my 
                              mother by name, and I was going to answer, but my mother put her hand to my mouth
                              to stop 
                              me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they went to another side, and then we left that place and went to another.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When

                              then.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A great number of our people were killed by the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The friends who were left 
                              buried the dead bodies, and there was very much weeping.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that there was not any fighting 
                              for some time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the soldiers came again to fight with us, and we ran into the bush, but they
                              
                              really came to fight with M M*.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They killed a lot of M M* people, and then one soldier came 
                              out to K K*, and the K K* people killed him with a spear.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And when the other soldiers

                              Then the soldiers fired a gun, and some people were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that they saw a little bit of 
                              my mother’s head, and the soldiers ran quickly towards the place where we were and
                              caught my 
                              grandmother, my mother, my sister, and another little one, younger than us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several of the 
                              soldiers argued about my mother, because each wanted her for a wife, so they finally
                              decided to 
                              kill her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They killed her with a gun—they shot her through the stomach—and she fell, and 
                              when I saw that I cried very much, because they killed my mother and grandmother,
                              and I was 
                              left alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My mother was near to the time of her confinement at that time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And they killed my 
                              grandmother too, and I saw it all done.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took hold of my sister and asked where her older 
                              sister was, and she said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“She has just run away.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They said, “Call her.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She called me, but I was 
                              too frightened and would not answer, and I ran and went away and came out at another
                              place, 
                              and I could not speak much because my throat was very sore.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I saw a little bit kwanga lying 
                              on the ground and I picked it up to eat.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At that place there used to be a lot of people, but when 
                              I got there there were none.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My sister was taken to P*, and I was at this place alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One 
                              day I saw a man coming from the back country.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He was going to kill me, but afterwards he 
                              took me to a place where there were people, and there I saw my step-father.........<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              He asked to buy me from this man, but the man would not let him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He said, “She is my slave 
                              now; I found her.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day the men went out fishing, and when I looked I saw the soldiers 
                              coming, so I ran away, but a string caught my foot and I fell, and a soldier named
                              N N N 
                              caught me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He handed me over to another soldier, and as we went we saw some Q* people 
                              fishing, and the soldiers took a lot of fish from them and a Q* woman, and we went
                              to P*, 
                              and they took me to the white man.

                              the morning they went away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After they went away we came back to the town, but we found 
                              it was all destroyed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We remained in our town a long time; the white man did not come back 
                              to fight with us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After a while we heard that R S was coming to fight us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>R S sent some 
                              Q* men to tell the N N* people to send people to go and work for him, and also to
                              send 
                              goats.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The N N* people would not do it, so he went to fight our town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we were told by 
                              the men that the soldiers were coming, we began to run away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My mother told me to wait for 
                              her until she got some things ready to take with us, but I told her we must go now,
                              as the 
                              soldiers were coming.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I ran away and left my mother, and went with two old people who were 
                              running away, but we were caught, and the old people were killed, and the soldiers
                              made me carry 
                              the baskets with the things these dead people had and the hands they cut off.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I went on with 
                              the soldiers.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then we came to another town, and they asked me the way and the name of the 
                              place, and I said “I do not know;”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they said, “If you do not tell us we will kill you,”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so I 
                              told them the name of the town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then we went into the bush to look for people, and we heard 
                              children crying, and a soldier went quickly over to the place and killed a mother
                              and four 
                              children, and then we left off looking for the people in the bush, and they asked
                              me again to show 
                              them the way out, and if I did not they would kill me, so I showed them the way.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took me 
                              to R S, and he told me to go and stay with the soldier who caught me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They tied up six 
                              people, but I cannot tell how many people were killed, because there were too many
                              for me to 
                              count.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They got my little sister and killed her, and threw her into a house and set fire
                              to the 
                              house.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When finished with that we went to OO*, and stayed there four days, and then we 
                              went to P P*, and because the people there ran away, they killed the P P* Chief.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We 
                              stayed there several days; then we came to P*, and from there we came on to Q Q*,
                              and 
                              there they put the prisoners in chains, but they did not put me in chains, and then
                              he (R S) 
                              went to fight with L L*, and killed a lot of people and six people tied up.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When he came back 
                              from L L* we started and came on to Q*.

                              did not know that the soldiers had come to fight them until she saw the people from
                              the other 
                              side of the town running towards their end, then they, too, began to run away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her father, 
                              mother, three brothers, and sister were with her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>About four men were killed at this scare.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It 
                              was at this fight that one of the station girls P P P was taken prisoner.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After several days, 
                              during which time they were staying at other villages, they went back to their own
                              town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They 
                              were only a few days in their own town when they heard that the soldiers who had been
                              at the 
                              other towns were coming their way too, so the men gathered up all their bows and arrows
                              and 
                              went out to the next town to wait for the soldiers to fight them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the men stayed behind 
                              with all the women and children.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that S S and her mother went out to their garden to 
                              work; while there S S told her mother that she had dreamed that Bula Matadi was coming
                              
                              to fight with them, but her mother told her she was trying to tell stories.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that S S 
                              went back to the house, and left her mother in the garden.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After she had been a little while in 
                              the house with her little brother and sister she heard the firing of guns.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When she heard that she 
                              took up her little sister and a big basket with a lot of native money[22] in it, but
                              she could not 
                              manage both, so she left the basket behind and ran away with the youngest child; the
                              little boy

                              ran away by himself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The oldest boys had gone away to wait for the soldiers at the other town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              As she went past she heard her mother calling to her, but she told her to run away
                              in another 
                              direction, and she would go on with the little sister.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She found her little sister rather heavy for 
                              her, so she could not run very fast, and a great number of people went past her, and
                              she was left 
                              alone with the little one.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she left the main road and went to hide in the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When 
                              night came on she tried to find the road again and follow the people who had passed
                              her, but she 
                              could not find them, so she had to sleep in the bush alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She wandered about in the bush for 
                              six days, then she came upon a town named S S*[22].<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this town she found that the soldiers 
                              were fighting there too.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Before entering the town she dug up some sweet manioc to eat, because 
                              she was very, very hungry.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She went about looking for a fire to roast her sweet manioc, but 
                              she could not find any.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she heard a noise as of people talking, so she hid her little sister in 
                              a deserted house, and went to see those people she had heard talking, thinking they
                              might be 
                              those from her own town, but when she got to the house where the noise was coming
                              from she 
                              saw one of the soldier’s boys sitting at the door of the house, and then also she
                              could not quite 
                              understand their language, so she knew that they were not her people, so she took
                              fright and ran 
                              away in another direction from where she had put her sister.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After she had reached the outside 
                              of the town she stood still, and remembered that she would be scolded by her father
                              and mother 
                              for leaving her sister, so she went back at night.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She came upon a house where the white man 
                              was sleeping; she saw the sentry on a deck chair outside in front of the house, apparently
                              asleep, 
                              because he did not see her slip past him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then she came to the house where her sister was, and 
                              took her, and she started to run away again.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They slept in a deserted house at the very end of 
                              the town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning the white man sent out the soldiers to go and look for people
                              all 
                              over the town and in the houses.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>S S was standing outside in front of the house, trying to 
                              make her sister walk some, as she was very tired, but the little sister could not
                              run away through 
                              weakness.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While they were both standing outside the soldiers came upon them and took them 
                              both.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the soldiers said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We might keep them both, the little one is not bad-looking;”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              but the others said “No, we are not going to carry her all the way; we must kill the
                              youngest 
                              girl.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So they put a knife through the child’s stomach, and left the body lying there where
                              they 
                              had killed it.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took S S to the next town, where the white man had told them to go and fight.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              They did not go back to the house where the white man was, but went straight on to
                              the next 
                              town.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white man’s name was C D.[23] The soldiers gave S S something to eat on the 
                              way.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When they came to this next town they found that all the people had run away.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p class="p  ">In the morning the soldiers wanted S S to go and look for manioc for them, but she
                              was 
                              afraid to go out as they looked to her as if they wanted to kill her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers thrashed her very 
                              much, and began to drag her outside, but the corporal (N N N) came and took her by
                              the hand and 
                              said, “We must not kill her; we must take her to the white man.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they went back to the 
                              town where C D was, and they showed him S S.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>C D handed her over to the care of a 
                              soldier.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this town she found that they had caught three people, and among them was a 
                              very old woman, and the cannibal soldiers asked C D to give them the old woman to
                              eat, 
                              and C D told them to take her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those soldiers took the woman and cut her throat, and 
                              then divided her and ate her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>S S saw all this done.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the morning the soldier who was 
                              looking after her was sent on some duty by C D, and before the soldier went out he
                              had 
                              told S S to get some manioc leaves not far from the house and to cook them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After he left 
                              she went to do as he had told her, and those cannibal soldiers went to C D and said
                              that 
                              S S was trying to run away, so they wanted to kill her; but he told them to tie her,
                              so the 
                              soldiers tied her to a tree, and she had to stand in the sun nearly all day.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the soldier who 
                              had charge of her came back he found her tied up.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>C D called to him to ask about S S, 
                              so he explained to C D what he had told S S to do, so he was allowed to untie her.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They 
                              stayed several days at this place, then B D asked S S if she knew all the towns round
                              
                              about, and she said yes, then he told her to show them the way, so that they could
                              go and catch 
                              people.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They came to a town and found only one woman, who was dying of sickness, and the 
                              soldiers killed her with a knife.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At several towns they found no people, but at last they came to 
                              a town where several people had run to as they did not know where else to go, because
                              the 
                              soldiers were fighting everywhere.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this town they killed a lot of people—men, women, and 
                              children—and took some as prisoners.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They cut the hands off those they had killed, and brought 
                              them to C D; they spread out the hands in a row for C D to see.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that they left to 
                              return to Bikoro.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They took a lot of prisoners with them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hands which they had cut off 
                              they just left lying, because the white man had seen them, so they did not need to
                              take them to 
                              P*.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of the soldiers were sent to P* with the prisoners, but C D himself and the other
                              
                              soldiers went to T T* where there was another white man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The prisoners were sent to S T.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              S S was about two weeks at P*, and then she ran away into the bush at P* for 
                              three days, and when she was found she was brought back to S T, and he asked her why
                              she had 
                              run away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She said because the soldiers had thrashed her.

                              was attacked by the State soldiers long ago.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was in S T’s time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She does not know if 
                              he was with the soldiers, but she heard the bugle blow when they were going away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was in 
                              the afternoon when they came, they began catching and tying the people, and killed
                              lots of them.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              A lot of people—she thinks perhaps fifty—ran away, and she was in the crowd with them,
                              but 
                              the soldiers came after them and killed them all but herself.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was small, and she slid into the 
                              bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The people killed were many, and women—there were not many children.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The children 
                              had scattered when the soldiers came, but she stayed with the big people, thinking
                              she might 
                              be safe.

                           <p class="p  ">When they were all killed she waited in the grass for two nights.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was very frightened, 
                              and her throat was sore with thirst, and she looked about and at last she found some
                              water in a 
                              pot.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She stayed on in the grass a third night, and buffaloes came near her and she was
                              very 
                              frightened—and they went away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the morning came she thought she would be better to 
                              move, and went away and got up a tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was three days without food, and was very hungry.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              In the tree she was near her grandmother’s house, and she looked around and, seeing
                              no soldiers, 
                              she crept to her grandmother’s house and got some food and got up the tree again.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The 
                              soldiers had gone away hunting for buffaloes, and it was then she was able to get
                              down from the 
                              tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers came back, and they came towards the trees and bushes calling out:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              “Now we see you; come down, come down!”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This they used to do, so that people, thinking 
                              they were really discovered, should give themselves up; but she thought she would
                              stay on, and 
                              so she stayed up the tree.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Soon afterwards the soldiers went, but she was still afraid to come 
                              down.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Presently she heard her grandmother calling out to know if she was alive, and when
                              she 
                              heard her grandmother’s voice she knew the soldiers were gone, and she answered, but
                              her voice 
                              was very small—and she came down and her grandmother took her home.

                           <p class="p  ">That was the first time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Soon afterwards she and her grandmother went away to another 
                              town called U U*, near V V*, and they were there some days together, when one night
                              the 
                              soldiers came.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white man sent the soldiers there because the U U* people had not taken 
                              to the State what they were told to take.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Neither her own people nor the U U* people knew 
                              there was any trouble with the Government, so they were surprised.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She was asleep.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her 
                              grandmother—her mother’s mother—tried to awaken her, but she did not know.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She felt the 
                              shaking, but she did not mind because she was sleepy.

                              not 
                              there, she ran out and called for her grandmother; and as she ran her brass anklets
                              made a noise, 
                              and some one ran after and caught her by the leg, and she fell and the soldiers took
                              her.

                              where I had run to.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then my elder sister called me:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“U U, come here.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I went.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              “Let us run away, because we have not any one to take care of us.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we were running 
                              away we saw a lot of W W* people coming towards us.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We told them to run away, war 
                              was coming.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Is it true?”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is true; they are coming.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The W W* 
                              people said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“We will not run away; we did not see the soldiers.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Only a little while they 
                              saw the soldiers, and they were killed.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We stayed in a town named X X*.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A male relative 
                              called me:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“U U, let us go;”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but I did not want to.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers came there; I ran away 
                              by myself; when I ran away I hid in the bush.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While I was running I met with an old man who 
                              was running from a soldier.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He (the soldier) fired a gun.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I was not hit, but the old man died.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              Afterwards they caught me and two men.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The soldiers asked:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Have you a father and mother?”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                              I answered, “No.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They said to me, “If you do not tell us we will kill you.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

                              “Father and mother are dead.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that my oldest sister was caught, too, in the bush, and 
                              they left my little brother and sister alone in the bush to die, because heavy rain
                              came on, and 
                              they had not had anything to eat for days and days.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At night they tied my hands and feet for 
                              fear that I should run away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the morning they caught three people—two had children; they 
                              killed the children.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Afterwards I was standing outside, and a soldier asked me, “Where are you 
                              going?”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I said, “I am going home.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He said, “Come on.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He took his gun; he put me in 
                              the house; he wanted to kill me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then another soldier came and took me.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We heard a big 
                              noise; they told us that the fighting was over, but it was not so.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we were going on 
                              the way they killed ten children because they were very, very small; they killed them
                              in the 
                              water.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they killed a lot of people, and they cut off their hands and put them into baskets
                              
                              and took them to the white man.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He counted out the hands—200 in all; they left the hands 
                              lying.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white man’s name was “C D.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After that C D sent us prisoners with soldiers 
                              to P* to S T.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>S T told me to weed grass.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I was working outside a soldier came and 
                              said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Come here;”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and when I went he wanted to cut my hand off, and so I went to the white 
                              man to tell him, and he thrashed the soldier.

                           <p class="p  ">On our way, when we were coming to P*, the soldiers saw a little child, and when they
                              
                              went to kill it the child laughed so the soldier took the butt of the gun and struck
                              the child with 
                              it, and then cut off its head.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day they killed my half-sister and cut off her head, hands, 
                              and feet because she had on rings.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her name was Q Q Q.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they caught another sister, and 
                              they sold her to the W W* people, and now she is a slave there.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we came to P* 
                              the white man said to send word to the friends of the prisoners to come with goats
                              to buy off 
                              some of their relatives.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A lot were bought off, but I had no one to come and buy me off because 
                              father was dead.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white man said to me, “You shall go to....”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The white man 
                              (S T) gave me a small boy to care for, but I thought he would be killed, so I helped
                              to get 
                              him away.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>S T asked me to bring the boy to him, but I said:<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“He has run away.”<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He said he would kill me, but....

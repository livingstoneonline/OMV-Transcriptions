                              was apparently 
                              close at hand and in command of the soldiers at the time.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I added that I had heard of other

                              if now 12.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His statement was fully confirmed by <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">S S S</span> and his relatives, who stood around him

                              me a deep cicatrized scar at the back of the head, just at the nape of the neck, and
                              said it was 
                              there the bullet had struck him.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He fell down, presumably insensible, but came to his senses 
                              while his hand was being hacked off at the wrist.<span class="space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I asked him how it was he could possibly lie

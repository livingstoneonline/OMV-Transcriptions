Nosutu's Letter.
Dictated by herself, and written in Caffre
by Tause, the next in the family after Mr.
Soga.
EMGWALI, October 1873
MY KIND FRIENDS,—For a long time I
have wished to thank you for what you have
done for me. Beloved friends, to-day I thank
you for what you have done for my son and
for myself. I thank you for what he was
taught, and for what he was prepared for, by
your means. From the beginning you acted
with great wisdom towards him, and thereby
conferred privileges and marvellous blessings
upon us all. You opened up every path for
him by which he was directed in the way of
salvation, and which you also showed unto
his people as well as to himself and to his
family.
Beloved, your work to my son I represent
with the words which were said respecting
man : The Creator first prepared a place for
man before He created him. When He had
finished all that was right for man, He created
him, and placed him in the midst of every
advantage. His commandment instructed
him, like him who has departed. Thus it
was so.
What can I speak to you ? Dearly beloved,
that which you began did you not finish ?
You gave the blood of your blood* to my son.
I have seen it with my own eyes. That event
taught us to know your habits, your disposition,
and your speech. That great event
united us very closely together. In effect it
seemed to say to my son : 'Tiyo Soga, go,
take this great enlightener amongst your
countrymen.' My friends, what can I say to
you ? He is gone to the place prepared for
him : look there for him ! Pardon me in
referring to this matter. Beloved, what gift
can be more highly esteemed than this ?
Rejoice, beloved ! we also rejoice with the
churches in Scotland. Rejoice ye ! Canzibe,
the bright, the morning star of spring, has
already risen upon Africa. The first teacher
belonging to our countrymen was sent forth
by you. Be glad, ye people of Caffraria !
Amaxosa, the first home of my son, now lying
desolate and forlorn, speaks of your laborious
toil. Rejoice ye ! These five gum trees still
standing remind me that, while the desolate
* Referring to his marriage.

and deserted homes of our countrymen are
covered with the couch grass, it is not so with
respect to that in which my son abides this
day. His home is now far distant from these
gum trees. Vain, then, is it for you to care
so much, and to be so anxious for the things
of this world.
But now there is a thing present to-day by
which I see him,* and yet do not see him. By
the kindness of one whom I do not know,
there is the stone that preserves the name of
my son, in order that the generation present,
and generations yet to come, may be told of
him whom we so greatly loved. That stone
is the first, so far as I know, that has been
erected by you (the churches in Scotland),
and on that account my heart is exceeding
glad.
My friends, I thank that kind friend for the
words which he wrote for that stone. I continue
still to hear them. It is written that a
prophet said to a certain man, 'Go, wash
seven times in Jordan, and thou shalt be
made whole.' He went. But the prophet did
not personally appear : he merely spoke the
word, although unseen. My thanks I give to
that unseen friend who wrote ; and true it is
that the works of a good man will follow
him.
There is one also who long ago began to
break up the new ground in my son, and who,
although not now in this world, is entitled to
my thanks. I thank our old missionary, Mr.
Chalmers.
It is proper also that I should thank Mr.
Govan, who so greatly benefited my son by
his instructions while he was under his hand.
Mr. Niven I also thank for all his labours in
behalf of my son.  Messrs. Cumming, Chalmers,
Sclater, R. Ross, J. Davidson, Longdon,
and R. Irvine—I thank them all for their
labour in connection with the burial of my
son.
My beloved friends, what more can I say?
I conclude with respectful salutations. Oh,
pray for me to the Lord, my friends, that
when I reach that day which has neither a
yesterday nor a to-morrow—a day which has
no end—I may receive strength to sustain me
in my unutterable weakness. —May you live
happy!
NOSUTU SOGA JOTELO,
* She refers here to the marble tablet set up in the Emgwali Church, presented by Mr. John McFarlane, sculptor, Dundee. The inscription upon it was composed by the late Dr. William Anderson, and the expense of its transmission to the Emgwali and its erection there were provided by Mr. William White Millar.

there for some days, he left with a caravan, or kafila, of about five
hundred persons. He had about seventy of his own followers; the

a distance of about 9 miles, on a plain road, where, at half that

Kedonda, and slept at Onegata, where two large rivers join ; slept

<p rend="no-indent">there is a small creek or river; continued travelling for 6 days,
through various ranges of hills, through the country of the tribe of
Loam by. The next two days passed the town of Kesunga; their
king is called Keringawarha, who is an usurper; the name of the
tribe is Wamefee:<ref target="#note_08">*</ref> this is all a hilly country. From thence
travelled 2 days to Marora; the king's name is Negaboo; the
name of the tribe Osagara<ref target="#note_09">&#134;</ref> (many sold in Zanzibar) : at this
place there are two rivers whirh irrigate the country, and food in
plenty; there are also numerous running streams from thti hills.
From Marora in one day reached the Bahar (the river, viz. the
Lufigi ?) : there is a large river, called Matoney, infested with
hippopotami; travelled close to the banks of the river for 8 days,
through the tribe called Yoaha:<ref target="#note_10">&#135;</ref> the country is hilly; and we
were constan1ly falling in with villages, at which we slept every
evening; when we got to Powaga. Travelled thence, through a
plain country, on the banks of the same river for 5 days longer
till we reached Osanga; from thence proceeded to Sanga in 3
days, leaving the river Matoney on our left hand, the hills were also
all left to the south; and the other part of the country was perfectly
level, principally sand and ironstone : thence travelled for 5 days
throng h the tribe of Toomba; the country quite plain, and well
populated-during the whole time from leaving the coast had no
rain. From Toomba to Jangwera 2 days; thence to Sangara 3
days: no villages or people. Sangara forms the east limit of the
Manumuse (Mono-moezi) tribe, and one of the kings lives there;
from this to the lake is occupied by the Manumuse (Mono-moezi)
tribe, which is under four independent sovereigns: the people are
very honest aud ciril to strangers; no instance has occurred of ill
tr,.mtmeut or injury. The road to the lake is plain, without hills.
Sangara to Ganda 5 days, quite plain, country well populated, more
so than before entering the Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country.
Sheep eight for one dollar, bullocks four for one dollar; but they
prefer a quarter of a dollar's value of cotton cloth. From Ganda
to Shesha 3 days; here is a sultan or king: the appearance of the
country as before. Hence to Sanjee 5 days; here another sheik
or sultan : at this place there is an abundance of iron-ore-country
quite lerel. From this latter place to Sagosee 2 clays, country
as before; thence Ogaree 3 clays, where there is a very large river
called Magrazie, with numerous hippopotami in it. Frnm this
place to the Grand Lake is 12 days, through a country called
Olia, a plain level country: on the banks of the lake is the great
Sultan of the Manumuse (Mono-moezi), whose minister's name is
Kegaw; the appearance of the people near the lake is that of the
A byssinians. The whole time from the shore of Africa being 140</p>

<p rend="no-indent">days, or 4¬Ω months, on the road; and during which time we travelled
62 days, at about the rate of 9 or 10 English miles daily;
but I have no means of ascertaining the exact distance.</p>
<p>The extent of the Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country is about
2 months from N. to S., and from E. to W. I¬Ω month. In
standing on the banks of the lake it can be seen across, in the
same manner as from Zanzibar to the main (which is 24 English
miles). Several islands were observable in it. On leaving the
African coast we travelled in a direction for the first month about
two points S. of where the sun sets, and afterwards continued to
travel exactly in the direction of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The river called Magrazie takes its origin from the lake, and
disembogues itself into the sea between the rivers Lindy and
Keelwa; and I am sure the rivers Lindy and Masoryre are
branches from it. Across the lake there is a great trade of ivory,
oil of a red colour, and slaves like those of Nubia. There is a
trade carried on from the W. bank of the lake to the W. coast; it
consists of white and blue cotton cloths, and some broad-cloths,
which are bartered for ivory. The time taken to reach the W. coast
from the lake is about 6 months. For two trassalors<ref target="#note_11">*</ref> of beads
you get four of ivory ; the beads costing about five dollars per
trassala.</p>
<p>Never heard of the dwarf human species spoken of: the people
near the lake are fairer than those near the coast. There is a great
sea or swell on the lake when the wind blows fresh : and it is well
known by all the people there that the river which goes through
Egypt takes its source and origin from the lake. The banks of the
lake are composed of sand-hills, thrown up by the waves; the water
is very deep, with great quantities of fish. On the W. side of the
lake the name of the tribe is Y oah; they are circumcised, and call
themselves Mohammedans. Some. of the boats are 6 fathoms long,
very narrow, and without sails. The Manumuse (Mono-moezi)
are pagans; and both sexes go nearly naked. Near the lake, and
through the Mono-moezi country there are no horses or camels,
but plenty of asses and a few elephants. In travelling in the
country from the E. side to the lake there is no danger; and from
the W., by paying a little to the different sultans, they would
forward you with the greatest safety. During the whole distance
the people with the caravan were healthy; they got plenty of
good and cheap food and water. The houses on the road and
at the lake are made of wood, and thatched with grass; no upper
stories, nor is there any chimney. Dogs are very numerous and
troublesome, some of a very large kind.</p>

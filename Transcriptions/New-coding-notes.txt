1) Not necessary to encode extra space at end of pages.

2) Don't use rend="left", rend="right" and rend="center" to place things on page. 
So, in other words, no <p rend="right">, <lb rend="right"/>, <seg rend="right"> etc.
Instead use a combo of: 
<space extent="1" unit="words"/>
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>
Getting it roughly to the proper spot via "words" then fine tune with "chars".
If something is left, no rend is necessary.

3) Add one <lb/> for blank pages:
<lb/><!-- blank page AM -->

4) If you need to indent an entire <p> put <space> before the <p> and the whole paragraph will indent:
<space extent="10" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/><p>
Note: This will also indent the first line extra, per normal indentation. If you don't want the first line to indent, use "no-indent" etc.
Also note: Therefore, no need to indent each line of the paragraph separately.
Also note: This doesn't work with <ab>. We'll figure out a solution for that when we come to a case of it.

5) I added the value dotted-underline for @rend. It's techically "dashed" but gives us what we need.

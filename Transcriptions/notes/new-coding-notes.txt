x 1) Not necessary to encode extra space at end of pages with extra <lb/>s. See my comments in the files.x 2) However, don't use <tag>rend="left"</tag>, <tag>rend="right"</tag>, and <tag>rend="center"</tag> to place things on page. So, in other words, no <p rend="right">, <lb rend="right"/>, <seg rend="right"> etc.
Instead use a combo of: 

<space extent="1" unit="words"/>
and
<space extent="1" unit="chars"/>

to position things. Get it roughly to the proper spot via "words" then fine tune with "chars". If something is left, no rend=”left” is necessary.To position things horizontally on the page, use variants of the <tag>space/</tag> tag: 

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><space extent="1" unit="words"/></egXML>
and
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><space extent="1" unit="chars"/></egXML>

Position the element roughly with "words", then fine tune with "chars".The only exception for this rule is <gi>milestone</gi>, where you can use <tag>rend="center"</tag> and <tag>rend="right"</tag> to position shorter lines (e.g., "half-line", "quarter-line", etc.) across the page.x 3) Add one <lb/> for blank pages:	<pb facs="liv_000074_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/><!-- blank page AM -->4) I added the value "dotted-underline" for @rend, so you can now use this value.5) I suggest we now use <roleName> for things like Dr., Mr., Lieut, Sultan (including Sultan of Zanzibar), etc. when these words are used as someone's title. If it's a reference to the occupation (rather than someone's title), then it's <term type="occupation">. So look at these examples:<persName><roleName>Sultan</roleName> Mboura</persName>and<persName>Mboura</persName> is the <term type="occupation">Sultan</term>6) When a hyphen is added at the end or beginning of a line when a word is broken over two lines, use <seg type="hyphen"> to mark it:<w>peo<seg type="hyphen">-</seg><lb break="no"/>ple</w>Do this also when you supply the hyphen:<w>unders<supplied><seg type="hyphen">-</seg></supplied><lb break="no"/>tand</w>And do this when the hyphen is a non-standard kind, as in the second line of the following example:<w>Cham<seg type="hyphen">-</seg><lb break="no"/><seg type="hyphen">=</seg>bezy</w>7) For catch words (see top of liv_000074_0005 for an example) code as follows:<seg type="catch">sleep</seg>8) Please use <seg type="metamark"> for carets and similar:<w>Lawa<add place="above">m<seg type="metamark">/</seg></add>ba</w>This example comes from liv_000074_0001.General note: One thing I’d like to do is create “reading copies” of the files that can be used in classrooms, etc. so #6, #7, and #8 will allow me to configure the texts in special ways, so that’s why these things have been added.

9) Minimal corrections.

<!-- Adrian, the text does not include the word 'for', but should it be supplied to make more grammatical sense? AM --><!-- I'm hesitant to include it as a matter of practice as if we start doing that then to be consistent we should add words every time they're missing. So unless supplying something is absolutely essential to clarifying context, I suggest we avoid doing it. AW  -->

                              and so completely defeated did the enemy appear

                              and in the effort to do so many thousand were driven by the

                              them and content myself with some 1,500. About 1 o'clock 
                              p.m. from 200 to 300 mounted men, with white caps and 
                              lances (which caused us to mistake them for his Excellency's

                              to at least 700 or 800 mounted men, who drew up in line 
                              in admirable order, and attempted to attack our front and 
                              left flank. As it was necessary to present a front, in order 
                              to protect our cattle and baggage, I formed three companies 
                              in skirmishing order, two in front and one thrown back on 
                              our left, keeping one in close order in support. The enemy 
                              charged up to us several times within 200 or 300 yards, but, 
                              daunted by the coolness and steadiness of the men lying 
                              down to receive them, dared not to approach nearer. As 
                              my instruction required me to proceed to <span class="geogName" title="A formally-named geographical entity.">Thaba Bossihgo</span>, I

                              sooner was this discerned by the enemy, than eo cheered and 
                              charged us, on which we halted and reformed in skirmishing

                              of their property; for those who fought—and fought well— 
                              were not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many 
                              were killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the 
                              fine, it would not have happened. I now desire not to <span class="word">con
                                 sider</span> you, Chief, as an enemy of the Queen, but I must

                              enter your country in search of plundered horses and cattle 
                              that may be stolen after this time. And I expect you to 
                              assist them; for though you are a great chief, it seems that 
                              you either do not, or cannot, keep your own people from 
                              stealing; and among the cattle you sent as part of your 
                              fine there were three oxen the property of <span class="persName" title="A formally-named person.">Mr. Bain</span>, of

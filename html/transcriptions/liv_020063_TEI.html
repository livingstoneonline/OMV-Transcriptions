<p class="p  ">THE GENERAL AND THE CAFFRE CHIEF.</p>
<p class="p  ">(From the Cape Town Mail Extra.)</p>
<p class="p  ">Foremost in importance among the events of the past 
month, we have to notice the expedition of General Cath- 
cart into the country of the Basuta chief Moshesh, and 
he sanguinary battle of Berea; followed by the submission 
of that chief and the prompt return of the troops into the 
colony.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">Having issued the proclamation which appeared in our 
last summary-declaring that his object was, "not to make 
war, but to settle all disputes, and to establish the blessings 
of peace," and commanding "all chiefs and men of all 
classes and tribes" to remain quiet and abide by his judg- 
ment and decision-General Cathcart proceeded across the 
Orange River into the Sovereignty, and on the lst of De- 
cember encamped at Commissie Drift, on the Caledon River, 
where he was joined by Colonel Eyre, 73d Regiment, and 
Colonel Duff, 74th, vith their respective columns; the 
whole force, including the column under his Excellenecy's 
immediate command, amounting to about 2,500 men of all 
arms. Here, in reply to an addrese presented to him by the 
inhabitants of Caledon, General Cathcart announced that 
he had summoned the chiefs Moshesh, Molitsani, Sikonyella, 
Moroko, and Gert Taaybosch to meet him at Platberg on,
he 13th, and that each of those chiefs would be compelled 
o pay the amount of cattle which the Commissioners, after 
due investigation, should think fit to award. On the 8th 
he camp moved forward towards Platberg, and was joined 
by a dctachment of the 45th Regiment, under Lieutenant 
Howard, with some fieldpieces; while 40 burghers, of a 
neighbourirg field-cornetey, turned out to protect the 
border, in the rear of the Governor's operations. Un- 
fortunatelv, during the first day's march, his Excellency 
lost the valuable aid of his military secretary, Colonel Se- 
mour, who was thrown violently from his horse, by which 
his left shoulder was fractured, and he had consequently to 
be conveyed in a cart to the neighbouring village of Smith- 
field.
</p>
<p class="p  ">On the morning of the 13th his Excellency arrived at 
Platberg, which he found deserted by the natives. In the 
evening two young chiefs, sons of Moshesh, came to the 
camp, but General Cathcrat refused to see them, and next 
morning they returned to their father's "great place," 
Thaba Bossigo, accompanied by Mr. Commissioner Owen 
who was the bearer of the following message:-
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Platbrg, Dec. 13, 1852.</p>
<p class="p  ">"Chief Moshesh,-When I was sent by the Queen to be 
Governor, and to command her army in this part of the 
world, six mouths past, I wrote to acquaint you and the 
other chiefs, and I told you that I would visit you as soon 
as the rebellion of the Gaikas and Tambookies and the Hot- 
entots was ended. This has been done, as you have no 
doubt learnt, and I now visit this country as I promised, 
and desire to see you and the other chiefs, as my friends, at 
my camp at Platberg, without delay.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"My proclamation will have told you the righteous cause 
in which I am come and what it is my duty to do.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"As I told you in my letter, I now hope my visit to you 
may be in peace; but I must do justice, whether it be by 
war or in peace. I had been told that you are a great chief 
and a good man, but I find that though you were a man of 
good words you have not done vhat you promised.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"I find, not only that you have not paid the fine of cattle 
imposed on you by the Assistant Commissioners, Major 
Hogge and Mr. Owen, and which you promised to pay for 
he robberies of cattle and horses committed by your people 
and with your knowledge, up to the time of your agreement 
with them; but since then you and the people over whom 
you rule, including Molitsani and Morosi and your own son. 
Letsea, with their people, and certain robbers called Jan 
Letell and Bashuli, have been stealing cattle from your 
neighbours, and otherwise doing them harm. Even mur- 
ders have been committed by them, and this village has been 
plundered and destroyed. In short, the Basuta people un- 
der your rule have become a nation of thieves.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"This state of things must not be, and I have come to 
put an end to it, and to restore peace between you and your 
neighbours if I can, and if not, to put you and your people 
out of the way of doing them wrong, and this I must do 
promptly.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"I will not therefore stop to talk, but tell you now once 
for all, that having carefully inquired into the business, and 
judging as justly and as mercifully as I can what is the 
amount of cattle and damage you should be required to re- 
store, I demand of you 10,000 head of cattle and 1,000 horses 
o be delivered over to the British resident at this place, 
within three days' time, in order to be restored to those from 
whom they have been stolen.
</p>
<p class="p  ">"If this be not done, I must go and take either cattle or 
other things from you and your people, and from Molitsani 
and his people, and if resistance be made it will then be 
war between us, and I must then take three times the 
amount of cattle, as well as kill many of your people and 
destroy their dwellings and kraals, which I should be very 
sorry to be obliged to do. But if this cattle be paid within 
hree days, and that I am assured peace is restored, I will 
ake the army back again in peace.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Now, Chief, if you are an honest man, it is for you to 
pay the just fine, which is not more than the cattle stolen, 
and save yourself and your people from ruin, or else pre- 
pare for war, for on the fourth day I must bring you to ac- 
count.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"You must also pay back to Sikonyella and Moroka what 
you have stolen from them, and be at peace with them. 
Carolus Batjee and his people must return to Platberg, and 
he boundaries fixed by Governor Sir Harry Smith must be 
respected.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"When all this is done, you must remain at peace with 
all your neighbours, and the Basutas must cease to be a 
nation of thieves, for if I come again it will not be to talk. 
but to make an end of the Basuta nation, as has been done 
of the Gaikas and Tambookie tribe of Mapassa.
</p>
<p class="p  ">"G. CATHCART."</p>
<p class="p  ">Next day Moshesh himself made his appearance, and an 
interview took place between him and the General, highly 
characteristicon both sides. The "talk" is thus reported in 
an official notice afterwards published:-
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I am glad to see you and to make your ac- 
quaintance.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I am glad to see the governor, as since his 
arrival in the country I have been expecting a visit from 
him, which his letter in October last led me to expect.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I told you in that letter that I hoped to 
meet you in peace, and I still hope so, as I look to you as 
he Great Chief in this part.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I hope so, too; for peace is like the rain that 
makes the grass grow, while war is like the wind which 
dries it up. You are right in looking to me; that is in ac- 
cordance with the treaties.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I will not now talk much, but wish to know 
whether you received my message yesterday, in which I 
made the demand of cattle and horses? I have nothing to 
alter in that letter.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-Do you mean the letter I received from Mr. 
Owen?
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-Yes.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I received the letter, but do not know where 
I shall get the cattle from. Am I to understand that the 
10,000 head demanded are a fine imposed for the thefts com- 
mitted by my people, in addition to the cattle stolen?
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I demand but 10,000 head, though your 
people have stolen many more, and I consider this a just 
award. It must be paid in three days.
</p>
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-Do the three days count from yesterday, or 
o-day?
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-To-day is the first of the three.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-The time is short, and the cattle many, will 
you not allow me six days to collect them?
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-You had time given you when Major Hogge 
and Mr. Owen made the first demand, and then promised 
o comply with it, but did not.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-But I was not quite idle. Do not the papers 
in the commissioner's hands show that I collected cattle?
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-They do, but not half of the number de- 
manded.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-That is true, but I have not now control 
enough over my people to induce them to comply with the 
demand, however anxious I may be to do so.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-If you are not able to collect them, I must 
go and do it, and if any resistance be made it will then be 
war, and I shall not be satisfied with 10,000 head, but shall 
ake all I can.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-Do not talk of war, for however anxious I 
may be to avoid it, you know that a dog when beaten will 
show his teeth.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-It will, therefore, be better that you should 
give up the cattle than that I should go for them.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I wish for peace; but have the same 
difficulty witb my people that you have in the colony- 
your prisons are never empty, and I have thieves among 
my people.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I would, then, recommend you to catch the 
hieves and bring them to me, and I will hang them.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I do not wish you to hang them, but to talk 
o them, and give them advice. If you hang them they 
cannot talk.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-If I hang them they cannot steal, and I 
am not going to talk any more. I have said that if you 
do not give up the cattle in three days, I must come and 
ake them.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-I beg of you not to talk of war.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Governor.-I have no more to say; I must either leave 
his in peace in three days, or go to Thaba Bossigo. I 
herefore advise you to go and collect the cattle as quickly 
as possible.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Moshesh.-Do not talk of coming to Thaba Bossigo; if 
you do I shall lay the blame on the boers from whom the 
cattle were stolen, and whom I requested to come and 
point out to me their cattle that I might restore them. 
I will go at once and do my best, and, perhaps, God will 
help me.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"After leaving his Excellency's tent, but before return- 
ing home, Moshesh sent to request that the day on which 
he interview took place might not count in the three. 
This request his Excellency acceded to."
</p> 
<p class="p  ">After the action in which Moshesh was defeated, as de- 
scribed in our yesterday's impression, a messenger arrived 
in camp, bearing a flag of truce, and the following letter to 
General Cathcart:-
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Thaba Bossigo, Midnight, Dec. 20, 1802.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Your Excellency,-This day you have fought against 
my people and taken much cattle. As the object for which 
you have come is to have a compensation for boers, I beg 
you will be satisfied with what you have taken. I entreat 
peace from you-you have shown your power-you have 
chastised-let it be enough, I pray you; and let me be no
[longer
longer considered an enemy of the Queen. I will try all I 
can to keep my people in order in the future.
</p>
<p class="p  ">"Your humble servant.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"MOSHESH."</p>
<p class="p  ">To which his Excellency returned the following reply:-</p> 
<p class="p  ">"Camp, Caledon River, Dec. 21,1852.</p>
<p class="p  ">"Chief Moshesh,-I bave received your letter. The 
words are those of a great chief, and of one who has the 
interests of his people at heart. But I care little for words. 
I judge of men by their actions. I told vou that if you did 
not pay the fine I must go and take it. I am a man who 
never breaks his word, otherwise the Queen would not have 
sent me here. I have taken the fine by force, and I am 
satisfied.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"I am not angry with your people for fighting in defence 
of their property; for those who fought-and fought well- 
were not all of them thieves, and I am sorry that many were 
killed. This is your fault; for if you had paid the fine it 
would not have happened. I now desire not to consider 
you, Chief, as an enemy ot the Queen, but I must proclaim 
martial law in the Sovereignty, to give to Commandants 
and Field-Cornets power to make commandoa in a regular 
manner, and, with the consent of the Resident, enter your 
country in search of plundered horses and cattle that may 
be stolen after tbis time. And I expect you to assist them; 
for though you are a great chief, it seems that you either do 
not, or cannot, keep your own people from stealing; and 
among the cattle you sent as part of your tine there were 
hree oxen, the property of Mr. Hain, of Bloemfontein, 
stolen since I crossed the Caledon river. Now, therefore, 
Chief Moshesh, I consider your past obligations fulfilled, and 
hat you will take measures for preventing such abuses 
in future.
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"In the meantime, as the Queen's representative, I sub- 
scribe myself, your friend,
</p> 
<p class="p  ">"GEORGE CATHCART.</p> 
<p class="p  ">"P.S.-Chief, I shall be giad to see either yourself or 
your sons, in the same friendly manner and in the same 
good faith as befre the fight, at Platberg, to-morrow or 
next day; but I shall now send away the army, and go back 
o the colony in a few days' time."

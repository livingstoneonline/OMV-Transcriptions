                              on both sides by small streams. During the dry season the Great

                              Old people make rain fall—make fires and offerings to bring it.
                              Many shooting-stars or comets: these run like serpents, and explode.
                              This takes place before the kings die. Thunder and

                              are plenty of cows and horses, but these are never employed in
                              work. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and tiger-cats. There
                              is also plenty of fish in the rivers: both men and women catch
                              them in nets; these nets are made of a kind of grass or hemp.
                              There are plenty of crocodiles and alligators; the people eat
                              them, and also the guana: sometimes the crocodile kills people
                              in the river. There are plenty of large trees and plenty of brush.
                              The houses are made round; they are built of mud, thatched all
                              over, and have small fire-places. They have plenty of fowls.
                              Each kind of stock live separately. They have plenty of <span class="collective" title="A collective term that signifies an individual or plural entity.">Guinea</span>

                              made them as well as the blacks: the brown or red coloured
                              people come with camels to buy slaves, &amp;c.; these red people

                              people build their images of clay. They also build a large
                              image with stone; this image only the king and courtiers worship:

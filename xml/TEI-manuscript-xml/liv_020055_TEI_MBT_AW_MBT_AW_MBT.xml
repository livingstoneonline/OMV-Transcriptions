<lb/>this conflict between the two, may be compared to a chronic <w>di-

<lb/>to its cure. The chronic disease being disturbed in its indolent

<lb/>uneasy; the disease, being disturbed in its indolent state may

<p rend="no-indent">now we have put the intruder, the new religion in the shade.</p> 
<lb/><p>It would certainly have been very faithless and cowardly on their part
<lb/>with out a struggle so at once to give way submissively to the
<lb/>newly imported religion from a strange country. But to proceed.
<lb/>The <placeName><term type="collective">Juju</term> house of skulls</placeName> has been <unclear>stringly</unclear> rebuilt, and the
<lb/>skulls are being replaced; the roof now rests upon iron <unclear><choice><sic>stensions</sic><corr>stanchions</corr></choice></unclear>
<lb/>or pillars instead of wood which soon decays, the roof is covered
<lb/>with galvanized corrugated iron sheets and the body of the
<lb/>temple is <unclear>covered</unclear> with plain sheets of the same materials, instead of <term type="plant">bamboo</term>: 
<lb/>now as to durability, it looks down with contempt on our
<lb/>temporary schoolroom close by. The fallen platform, the
<lb/>receptacle of the bones and limbs of human victims has been
<lb/>newly erected and the scattered bones picked up and replaced
<lb/>on it, and to shew that they were not beaten, an additional
<lb/>platform was erected, on both which are to be seen <del>the</del>
<lb/>fresh bones of three human victims newly taken as prisoners
<lb/>of war, killed and devoured: these victims were, a <hi rend="underline">man</hi>,
<lb/>a <hi rend="underline">woman</hi> and <hi rend="underline">her child</hi>, relatives of their opponents, caught
<lb/>from the opposite side of the river. Having been thus caught
<lb/>killed and eaten, their bones and skulls were added to the 
<lb/>trophies in the temple. Our native agents were <w>eyewit-
<lb/>nesses</w> of these attrocities only a few months ago: the <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">people</add> made
<lb/>no disguise of the acts, they rather gloried in the deeds.</p>
<lb/><p>A priestess was seen bearing one of the gory skulls in 
<lb/>her hands to be prepared and deposited in its place; while
<lb/>the body was being prepared as animal sacrifice among the 
<lb/>members. That our agents were not <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">only</add> shocked but frighted at
<lb/>the sight, may easily be concluded, but they could not <w>inter-
<lb/>fere</w> for one may sooner disturb a <term type="animal">lion</term> at its prey.</p>
<lb/><p>Several times I passed by the Temple, and these fresh limbs
<lb/>caught my eyes, my heart <del>as</del><add place="over-text">is</add> stirred to appeal to him <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">who has the power,</add> to turn

<lb/><p>for the dark places of the earth are full of the <w>habita-
<lb/>tions</w> of cruelty." Surely God will hear our prayers.</p>
<lb/><p>But there is a division in the ccamp of <persName>Satan</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p>Having given a fair statement of the renewed efforts of
<lb/>idolatry, to strengthen itself in the face of christianity, I now
<lb/>proceed to give some accounts of the silent, but sure progress
<lb/>of the mission.</p>
<lb/><p>English speaking is prevalent here, in the same way and
<lb/>degree it is understood and spoken in all the trading ports
<lb/>along this coast, we therefore take advantage of it in teaching the
<lb/>children to read English school books, while we preach to the
<lb/>native congregation through an interpreter, at the same time
<lb/>we are preparing books in the native tongue.</p>
<lb/><p>Since the school and Sunday services have been removed
<lb/>from the temporary schoolroom in <settlement>Bonny Town</settlement> to the new
<lb/>mission premises near <settlement>Andony village</settlement>, things have been going
<lb/>on more comfortably. The distance between this and <settlement>Bonny
<lb/>Town</settlement> is about 15 minutes walk on the beach; the children
<lb/>have been regular in their attendance both at school and
<lb/><add place="marginleft">Church on</add> Sundays, though sometimes interrupted by the tide at high water.
<lb/>I propose cutting a new straight road through the swamps to <w>con-
<lb/>-nect</w> this and the town, clear out of the tide, to facilitate <w>commu-
<lb/>nication</w> without the use of a canoe at high water, which is
<lb/>approved of by the chiefs who also promise their cooperation.</p>
<lb/><p>The mission station has become a playground to the children<!-- overwriting or correction in author's hand? MBT -->
<lb/>where they spend their <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">time</add> most cheerfully before and after school
<lb/>hours daily. To teach them habits of industry, small patches 
<lb/>of ground have been divided among them for gardening, on which
<lb/>each one made his <unclear>beds grew</unclear> his vegetables, and when riped
<lb/>	and reaped, they took home to their parents as the produce
<lb/>of their own growing. The girls improve in <unclear>working</unclear> and ironing.</p>    
<lb/><p>When I left here last May, the station was only just opened
<lb/>for use, but many necessary supplies were needed to make

<lb/><p>it complete, one of those necessaries was the want of a large
<lb/>bell to announce the time of school to the clindren in <settlement>Bonny Town</settlement>,
<lb/>but this want was supplied in a way I least expected.</p>
<lb/><p>There was lying on the ground in <settlement>Bonny Town</settlement>, a very large
<lb/>bell 3 1/2<!-- half needs to be styled? MBT --> feet in diameter, bearing this inscription&#8211;
<lb/><space extent="1" unit="words"/>"<persName>William Dobson</persName>, founder, <settlement>Downham <!-- Double-checked the location.

<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><add place="marginleft">X</add> <space extent="3" unit="chars"/>Little did I think this Bell could be made use of again
<lb/>even in <settlement>Bonny Town</settlement> where it had been lying on the ground
<lb/>for years, and no one seemed to have any disposition to
<lb/>trouble himself in putting up such an unweildy thing,
<lb/>though I intimated something of its use in the town to late
<lb/><persName>King Pepple</persName>. But contrary to my expectations, during my
<lb/>absence, at the suggestion of <persName>King George</persName>, probably from his 
<lb/>late father, <persName>Oko Jumbo</persName> very readily and willingly <w>under-
<lb/>took</w> to put up the Bell at the mission station, at his
<lb/>own expense, and so he did. He bought two stout masts
<lb/>well coppered at the bottom to protect them from decay, on
<lb/>which the Bell was put up; it has cost him already
<lb/>&#163;14. sterling, and as he is about putting over it a roof
<lb/>of corrugated galvanized iron sheets it will not cost him
<lb/>less than 	&#163;24. spent for the benefit of the mission.</p>
<lb/><p>I was told by <persName>King George</persName>, that the fact of the Bell being
<lb/>removed out of <settlement></settlement> to the mission station without
<lb/>any opposition from the priests, chiefs, and elders was a <del extent="1" unit="words">great</del>
<lb/>sign that a great change is taking place here for the better,
<lb/>because such relics of their former king are generally regarded
<lb/>as Juju (sacred) not to be removed by anybody out of the
<lb/>place; but in this case not a word was said against its
<lb/>removal to the mission station and its use, by any person.</p>
<lb/><p>After <persName>Oko Jumbo</persName> had gone through the trouble and

<lb/><p>stem of the heavy clapper, being rusty from having lain so long
<lb/>on the corroding sand, in the act of being struck, snapped asunder,
<lb/>the hammer came down, and the bell was tongueless; but <persName>Oko
<lb/>Jumbo</persName> determined to have it mended by the engineers<!-- code as group? MBT --> of the
<lb/>Royal Mail steamer, and so he did; he also took the forethought
<lb/>of taking a shot, about seven pounder, with him to be boxed and
<lb/>made a spare clapper of, should the old mended one be broken
<lb/>again which was done: true enough, the old repired clapper was
<lb/>put on, <del type="strikethrough">again,</del> but a few strokes snapped the corroded stem
<lb/>again, so the spare one is now in use; though not so heavy as

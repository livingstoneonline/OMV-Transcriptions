<p>Very Honoured Fathers,

<lb/>to tell you and our other <term type="collective">Christian</term> friends in <country>England</country> that I
<lb/>arrived safe among my own people. We had a very good passage out
<lb/>from <country>England</country> to <region>the Cape</region> where we stayed for a short time and then
<lb/>proceeded up the country in company with <persName>Mr Read</persName> and <persName>Mr

<lb/>as soon as they got the message they came to see me
<lb/>at <settlement>Philipton</settlement> where we spent a few days together in talking
<lb/>of what I had seen in <country>England</country> - how kindly I had been
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> by the <term type="collective">Christians</term> of <country>England</country> &amp; how greatly they
<lb/>loved &amp; felt for the <term type="collective">Caffers</term> &amp; other <term type="collective">natives</term> of this &amp; other <!-- Adrian, this is spelt Caffres in other documents - should I orig/reg or leave? HB -->
<lb/>parts of the world - I also told them what <persName>Lord <unclear cert="low">Glenelg</unclear></persName>
<lb/>had told me to tell them "<choice><abbr>viz</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice> that they must maintain peace with
<lb/>the <region>Colony</region>. That if the <term type="collective">Colonists</term> ill treat us that we must

<lb/>do them justice they can send their complaints to

<lb/>to him &amp; that he would see that justice is done to them. 
<lb/>at this they were all very much pleased and said to each
<lb/>other this is the word of the great man."<metamark/> From <settlement>Philipton</settlement> I <!-- Again, not sure if we're coding the later-hand bracket. HB -->
<lb/>I rode to the <geogName><term type="animal"><choice><sic>Buffalos</sic><corr>Buffaloes</corr></choice></term> River</geogName> where I found my dear wife
<lb/>and children quite well. It was a great day for my people
<lb/>who stood about me, gazed at me &amp; said how stout you
<lb/>are. how well you look. we can see that you have
<lb/>been treated well by that nation. Have you really been
<lb/>over the great water? and come back unhurt too? we
<lb/>really now see that these people are our friends. Some
<lb/>said how often did you outspan? where and how
<lb/>did you cook your victuals? To all these questions
<lb/>I had to give answers. I told them that I was treated as
<lb/>kindly and tenderly as if I had been a little child, both in
<lb/><country>England</country> and <country>Scotland</country>. I am glad to<del type="strikethrough">to</del> <add place="above">to</add> say that the Lord is

<lb/>many more of both sexes are inquiring the way to the Kingdom
<lb/>of God some of whom will soon I trust be added to the
<lb/>church - My prayer to God is that he may more abundantly
<lb/>pour out his spirit upon the minds of the <term type="collective">caffres</term> and
<lb/>that Jesus our Redeemer may in the conversion of many
<lb/>of my poor countrymen see of the <unclear cert="low">travail</unclear> of his soul
<lb/>and be satisfied - <metamark/> I hope missionaries will soon come <!-- Again the later added mark, this time | . HB -->

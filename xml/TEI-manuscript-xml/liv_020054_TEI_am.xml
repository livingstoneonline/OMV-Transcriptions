<p><hi rend="caps">A King Defending Himself from a Charge 
of Murder</hi>.&#8212;The following letter appears in yesterday's
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, under date, "<placeName>Cape Palmas</placeName>, <country>Liberia</country>, <date when="1876-01-24">Jan. 24</date>:"&#8212;
"Sir,&#8212;I am greatly astonished and regret to hear that
there is a report in circulation charging me with the brutal
murder of <persName>Mr. Selim Aga</persName>, a <term type="collective">British</term> subject, then resided
at <placeName>Cape Palmas</placeName>. I therefore feel myself called upon to
apologise in the following statement:&#8212;The whole of the
<term type="collective">Liberian</term> army attacked my big town on the morning of
the <date when="1875-10-10">10th of October last</date>, at five o'clock a.m. My people
and myself were awakened by the tremendous noise of
their rifles and cannons; and after having seriously
engaged with them in battle, they were routed by my
soldiers. <persName>Mr. Selim Aga</persName>, while retreating with and in
the midst of the <term type="collective">Liberian</term> army, was accidentally shot and
killed. His dead body was not found and recognised until
a few hours afterwards, being armed with a sword. This
is a genuine, true, and only circumstantial account of the
event. Any statement or statements beyond or below this
is a result of mere prejudice intentionally fabricated for
my serious injury. A word or two in conclusion.
Although I am a heathen, yet I am neither such a
savage nor cannibal at all. I have never heard
that any of my predecessors or myself have
ever killed, massacred, or brutally murdered any
black or white foreigner or foreigners. We have
here some foreigners in the midst of the <settlement><term type="collective">Liberian</term>
settlement</settlement> within our reach representing different
civilised nations by their respective flags&#8212;viz., of the 
<term type="collective">German</term> nation, <persName>Messrs Lehman</persName> and <persName>Woerman</persName>; of
<term type="collective">French</term>, <persName>M. Verdire</persName>; of <term type="collective">English</term>, <persName>Messrs Allen</persName>, <persName>Burton</persName>,
and <persName>Hazeley</persName> of <country>Sierra Leone</country>; of <country>America</country> or <country>U.S.</country>, <persName>Revs.
Mr. Davis</persName> and <persName>Fair</persName>. These persons we have never 
troubled in the present war. How could we single out
and brutally murder <persName>Mr. Selim Aga</persName>, and leave the others
as above mentioned unmolested? How could I venture
to raise my puny arm against the <orgName><term type="collective">British</term> Government</orgName> as
to perpetrate, for the first time, such a black deed in
murdering a <term type="collective">British</term> subject in defiance of the <term type="collective">British</term> 
power, especially when I am at war with the <term type="collective">Americo&#8211;
Liberians</term>? I deeply regret that my people have thus
accidentally killed <persName>Mr. Selim Aga</persName> in the midst and issue
of the battle, which could not possibly be avoided. I
therefore do earnestly deprecate and crave the pardon and
mercy of the <orgName><term type="collective">British</term> Government</orgName> for the commission of
the casualty in question. I still do humbly implore the
sympathy of the <term type="collective">Christian</term> world in the present war with
the <term type="collective">Liberians</term>, which they have unjustly declared against
me. I have the honour to be your most humble servant,
<hi rend="caps"><persName>King Weah</persName>, of the <region>Grebo Reunited Kingdom</region></hi>."</p>

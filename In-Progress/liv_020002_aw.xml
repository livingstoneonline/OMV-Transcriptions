He say, "Twenty rupee," and I say, "That 's all money I got." He say, "I .don't care, I want twenty rupee, now, quick ! " I give it him, and I don't got any money in my pocket. And I went in police station, and soon I see myself, and I set down and cry. When watchman come, asker me, "Why you cry ?" He think somebody beat me. I told I cry because I no home this country, no fren. He asker me what language speak. I say, "I speak Arab"; and he laugh me, and say you can't go far, we no speak Arab in this coun try [Madagascar].

<p>I think Mis'r Stanley is very fine man. We lose many people in Dark Forest for hunger. I don't forget why I say Mis'r Stanley is very fine man, he think for his people more than for himself.- One day he told me, "I think I liker my people very much, because my people is my home. If I lose my people I can't go any where." All native in Africa liker Mis'r Stan ley. Ev'rything he want and do, he call his people, asker first. And me sure many people say Mis'r Stanley bad man all je'lus, have nothing in head, all head full flies. I see six hundred people myself liker Mis'r Stanley, speak well for him. I been three year and half with him, he teach me very well. I enjoy my travel with him. He bring me back to Zanzibar, home. I asker him to come to Europe with him. I come for good time with him in Europe. He is here July, and have wife, good heart and fine looking. We all went through Europe, France, Germany, Italy, Switz'land, come back  to London and went to Scotlan' and Irelan' and all over Englan'. He taker me over here to 'Merica now, and I liker 'Merica very much. I think there is nice ladies in 'Merica. And I think there is nice boys and girls. I think they have nice schools in 'Merica. I believe this is a rich country. I been in New York, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Springfield, Boston, Worcester, Providence, Chelsea, Rochester, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, and too many places in all the country that no have time to say, and I forget his name.</p>

<lb/><p>I have no time to tell you how good time have this country. I like this country very much. I write book in Arab, and I go to pub lish when I go home. I have no time tell you how fine ladies this country. How fine boys. I 'm sure I got something to say when I get home. Goo'-bye. I sail Wednesday to Englan'. Soon as I get to Englan' I go home to Zanzibar.</p>

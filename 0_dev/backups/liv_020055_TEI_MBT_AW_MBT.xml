<p>I have observed evident tokens of a silent, but mighty
<lb/>struggle for mastery between <term type="collective">demon worship</term> and <term type="collective"><choice><sic>christianity</sic><corr>Christianity</corr></choice></term>,
<lb/>this conflict between the two, may be compared to a chronic <w>di-
<lb/>sease</w>, on the one part, which has been been left to remain indolent
<lb/>for years, till an effective remedy, on the other part, is applied
<lb/>to its cure. The chronic disease being disturbed in its indolent
<lb/>state, the patient will more or less feel the painful action 
<lb/>of the physic which will as it may be expected make him
<lb/>uneasy; the disease, being disturbed in its indolent state may
<lb/>shift its position, as it is said, is experienced in the gout or
<lb/>rheumatism, till by perservering applications of the medicine,
<lb/>effectual cure is obtained.</p>

<lb/><p>It woudl certainly have been very faithless nad cowardly on their part
<lb/>with out a struggle so at once to give way submissively to the
<lb/>newly imported religion from a strange country. But to proceed.
<lb/>The Juju house of skulls has been <unclear>stringly</unclear> rebuilt, and the
<lb/>skulls are being replaced; the roof now rests upon iron <unclear>stensions</unclear>
<lb/>or pillars instead of wood which soon decays, the roof is covered
<lb/>with galvanized corregated iron sheets and the body of the
<lb/>temple is covered with plain sheets of the ssame materials, instead of bamboo: 
<lb/>now as to durability, it looks down with contempt on our
<lb/>temporary schoolroom close by. The fallen platform, the
<lb/><unclear>xxxptacle</unclear>of the bones and limbs of human victims has been
<lb/>newly erected and the scattered bones picked up and replaced
<lb/>on it, and to shew that they were not beaten, an additional
<lb/>platform was erected, on both whihc are to be seen <del>the</del>
<lb/>fresh bones of three human victims newly taken as prisoners
<lb/>of war, killed and devoured: these victims were, a <hi rend="underline">man</hi>,
<lb/>a <hi rend="underline">woman</hi> and <hi rend="underline">her child</hi>, relatives of their opponents, caught
<lb/>from the opposite side of the river. Having been thus caught
<lb/>killed and eaten, their bones and skulls were added to the 
<lb/>trophies in the temple. Our native agents were <w>eyewit-
<lb/>nesses</w> of these attrocities only a few months ago: the <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">people</add>made
<lb/>no disguise of the acts, they rather gloried in the deads.</p>
<lb/><p>A priestess was seen bearing one of the gory skulls in 
<lb/>her hands to be prepared and deposited in its place; while
<lb/>the body was being prepared as animal sacrifice among the 
<lb/>members. That our agents were not <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">only</add>shocked but frighted at
<lb/>the sight; may easily be concluded, but they could not <w>inter-
<lb/>fere</w> for one may sooner disturb a lion at its pray.</p>
<lb/><p>Several times I passed by the Temple, and these fresh limbs
<lb/>caught my eyes, my heart was stirred to appeal to him <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">who has the power,</add>to turn

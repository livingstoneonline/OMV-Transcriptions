                        <p>Since my return from <country>England</country> the number of schools has
                            been increased to 17; in which are daily taught, 400 pupils, whose
                            progress is very encouraging to us, and credible to the young native
                            teachers who have the charge of them. The course of instruction
                            comprehends reading, (English and Dutch,) writing, arithmetic,
                            geography, scripture history, and elements of the use of the globe.
                            During the past year we have had several most interesting examinations,
                            which excite great interest among both parents and children. Besides our
                            monthly examinations of individual schools, we have had an annual and
                            general examination of all the schools; and, as these are widely
                            scattered, we invariably take 3 days to accomplish this eating cutie.
                            The children have to bring their provisions and bedding with them.</p>
                        <p>At our last annual examination we were honoured by the presence of
                                <persName>Capt. Stretch</persName>, diplomatic agent in
                                <region>Caffreland</region>, as our chairman. This gentleman feels
                            deeply interested in the education of the rising generation among the
                                <term type="collective">Hottentots</term>. We had about 1000 pupils

                        <p>Within the last eight months, six of our pupils from the
                                <settlement>Philipton</settlement> day-school passed their
                            examinations for the office of schoolmaster, and have been appointed to
                            their several spheres of labour; and it is pleasing and encouraging to
                            see the attitude that evince in imparting instruction, and the pleasure
                            they take in communicating knowledge to their little countrymen. The
                            more I see of working the system of native agency, and of growing
                            intelligence and devotedness of our young men, more confirmed I become
                            in the police we must ultimately look for the great results of
                            Missionary enterprise. Whether we look at the system in point of
                            economy, the constitutional qualifications of the natives to endure the
                            influence of climate, their acquaintance
                            [with<!-- Typo in original. MT --> the habits, customs, and language of
                            their countrymen, facilities they possess of ingratiating themselves
                            with the people; and consequently the ready access they can obtain their
                            understandings and affections;&#8212;all these considerations seem to
                            warrant the conviction we entertain of the success that would attend the
                            establishment of a comprehensive and well organised system of native
                            agency. The appointment of native schoolmasters has had a suprisingly
                            beneficial effect on the young men, and even on the school children; as
                            many of them are thereby encouraged to hope that they may at some future
                            time be enabled to fill the situation of teacher, or other office of
                            respectability, and are consequentaly led to apply themselves more
                            diligently to the improvement of their minds, in order to qualify
                            themselves to undertake it.</p>

                        <p>Previous to appointment the schoolmasters go through the following course
                            ;&#8212;English reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, <term

                                >English</term> history, use of the globes, natural history, and
                            English grammar. After their appointment they are expected to pursue
                            their studies by coming to <settlement>Philipton</settlement> once a
                            week to receive such aid as we can give them; and I am glad to say that
                            their improvement is very encouraging. The books the
                                <orgName>Society</orgName> sent us have been particularly
                            serviceable in promoting our object.</p>

                        <p>Since my return from <country>England</country>, three new school-rooms
                            have been built, and fourth is building, and all the people's own

                        <p>A committee under this name has been appointed, whose duty it is to
                            co-operate with the Missionaries in extending the work of education in
                            the Settlement, and watching over the instruction of the children. I
                            have found it advisable to invite some of the most intelligent and
                            respectable of our young men to become members of the committee. No
                            sooner was the proposal made to them, that they came forward to join it.
                            Their principal work, as I have said, is to assist the Missionary in
                            founding new schools, to see after the conduct of the schoolmasters, to
                            take care that the people contribute regularly towards their support and
                            to oversee the building of school-rooms, &amp;c. In the first place, but
                            the appointment of such a committee, the people become interested in,
                            and qualified for, the management of their own affairs, so as gradually
                            to carry on the education of their own children, without looking ofr
                            assistance to the parent <orgName>Society</orgName>; and, secondly, it
                            supplies a stimulant to the exertion <gap extent="1" unit="words"
                                ><!-- in? MT--></gap> our schools. There is nothing like giving men
                            a voice in the management of their own institutions. <choice>

                            </choice> seldom fails to produce good effects.</p>
                        <p>Besides superintending the schools, I take my regular turn in preaching
                                and <!--  itinerating? MT--> among the people. To this I add superintendence, in part, of the two recently established settlements of <settlement>Blinkwater</settlement> and <geogName><settlement>Fish River</settlement></geogName>; both of which I am happy to say are doing well under the care of our two native teachers, <persName>Dirk Hather</persName>, and <persName>Andreis Jagers</persName>. On my last visit to the <geogName><settlement>Fish River</settlement></geogName>,I was truly gratified to see the activity and devotedness of the native teacher to the <w>con-<pb facs="liv_020033" n="0003"/><fw><seg rend="center caps"><seg rend="small">For April</seg><seg rend="left">57</seg></seg></fw>cerns</w> of the people, both spiritual and temporal. I would conclude by desiring the continuance of an interest in the prayers of the Directors, and our other Christian friends in <country>England</country>, that the Lord would grant unto us greater grace, more devotedness to the work to which we trust he has called us, and make us faithful unto death.</p>

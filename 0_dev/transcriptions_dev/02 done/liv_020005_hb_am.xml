<lb/>the first night we had a report of a <term type="animal">Lion</term> being at hand, we

<lb/>it the same evening of my arrival - and next evening at

<lb/>for our wagons Six in number, the chief was with me,
<lb/>we assembled under the trees round large <term type="plant">pines</term> to give thanks

<lb/><p><space extent="5" unit="words"/>Early next day we proceeded on the

<lb/>place we met <persName>Macomo</persName>, with his <unclear cert="low">chief</unclear>, who made with us to
<lb/>opposite his residence, here also I met the rest of my
<lb/>family son and two daughters. <persName>James</persName> had been sick and
<lb/>his sisters had remained at home to take care of him, but
<lb/>he was so far recovered as to be able to come to meet us, - our

<lb/>and we were <choice><orig>doubtfull</orig><reg>doubtful</reg></choice> whether we should meet again in this

<lb/>we rested for the night at <unclear cert="low">Black water</unclear>, the place intended for
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup double-underline">r</hi> Colderwood</persName>, - <persName>Macoma</persName> sent a fat <term type="animal">cow</term> for our numerous

<lb/>we were about 20 miles from <settlement>Philipton</settlement>.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="8" unit="words"/>Next day we <w>con<seg type="hyphen">=</seg>
<lb break="no"/>tinued</w> our journey, and by constant relays of <term type="animal">oxen</term>
<lb/>got to my sweet home, long wished for home, early
<lb/>in the afternoon - the sight of my cottage of wattle &amp; dab
<lb/>rejoiced my heart, and I <unclear cert="medium">retired</unclear> to my chamber and the

<lb/><p><space extent="8" unit="words"/>The Sunday was a <w>re<seg type="hyphen">=</seg>

<lb/><unclear cert="medium"><persName>Tazabe</persName></unclear>, and <unclear><persName>Botman</persName></unclear> <term type="collective">Caffre</term> chiefs were present with

<lb/><p><space extent="8" unit="words"/>I found the <w>Settle<seg type="hyphen">=</seg>
<lb break="no"/>ment</w> gradually recovering from the effects of the war,
<lb/>new cottages were erected instead of those burnt in the war,
<lb/>the lands were again in a State of cultivation and

<lb/>but many had suffered in such a way as never again <add place="below"><seg type="metamark"/>to</add>

    <pb facs="liv_020005_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>to recover. the <settlement>Settlement</settlement> had also suffered greatly, the two
<lb/>last years for want of rain and thus a failure in part
<lb/>of their <term type="plant_foodstuff">crops</term>, hunger has been very severe indeed, so
<lb/>that it was reported that several had died for want of food,
<lb/>the want of rain had been general throughout the <region>Colony</region>,
<lb/>but I was particularly pleased that I heard no complaints
<lb/>either on account of present or past afflictions, they
<lb/>had patiently endured, the Lord has soothed their sorrows,
<lb/>by the consolation of the Gospel, and his special presence
<lb/>nor have I heard a single expression of revenge against
<lb/>the <term type="collective">Caffres</term>, so different to other parts of the <region><subst><del>colony</del> <add place="inline">community</add></subst></region> in
<lb/>the <region>Colony</region> their eyes saw now their teachers again
<lb/>and this seemed to make up for all.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="8" unit="words"/>The State of the Church
<lb/>was most cheering, during our absence the members had
<lb/>been as the heart of one man, prayer meetings had been
<lb/>held thrice a week at the different places, the females
<lb/>had also held a prayer Meeting among themselves every
<lb/>Wednesday from which they received so much benefit that
<lb/>they have continued <add place="below"><seg type="metamark">^</seg></add> <add place="above">it</add> - the members had with very few
<lb/>exceptions remained firm, and were on the increase
<lb/>our reliable <persName>Brother Barker</persName> had visited them several
<lb/>times and baptized several, - the arrival of my dear
<lb/>Son a few Months before me had proved a great
<lb/>consolation and blessing, he had also baptized several,
<lb/>so that I may say, the Lord was in the midst of them,
<lb/>The candidates also <unclear cert="low">or enquirers</unclear> that we had left behind
<lb/>in the beginning of <date when="1835">1835</date>, had for the most part stood
<lb/>Firm, not withstanding <choice><sic>extreem</sic><corr>extreme</corr></choice> want on the one
<lb/>hand and temptations of various kinds on the other,
<lb/>their number had been increased rather than <choice><sic>deminished</sic><corr>diminished</corr></choice>
<lb/>they were still continuing to increase and that chiefly
<lb/>through the instrumentality of our native <choice><sic>Brethern</sic><corr>Brethren</corr></choice>,
<lb/>many of whom have been and are indefatigable.
<lb/>The number of <unclear cert="medium">hearers</unclear> generally was such that the
<lb/>place could not contain them, thus they had commenced
<lb/>a new wing and we have since completed it 40 feet by 20.

<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>We have at present about 40 candidates, or as they are

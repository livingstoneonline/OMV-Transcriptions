One More Voice does not have a project team, but rather is conceived as bringing together the work of a series of contributors. In this spirit, we have created what we are calling a "low-bar" publication method. Our method focuses on the production of high-quality scholarship, but prioritizes short-form, critical interventions â€“ interventions that are less resource-intensive than more traditional scholarship. This emphasis extends our overall minimal computing approach to the realm of critical argument, but our use of the term "interventions" also draws inspiration from Matt Gold and Lauren Klein's calls for short "provocations" in the context of their Debates in the Digital Humanities book series. The low-bar publication method likewise means that project contributors can stay professionally active at a time when all of us are distracted by the Coronavirus epidemic or working under challenging conditions, and when access to the kinds of archival sources many of us need for longer-form scholarship has been curtailed.

		<p><span class="bold site-blue">Texts: Primary and Supporting Materials</span></p>
		
		<p>At present, <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> publishes a small selection of critically-edited and encoded primary materials and, in some cases, PDF versions of original published documents; all of these currently relate to nineteenth-century Africa. Each item is presented in a form ready for educational use, as noted on our <a href="index.html">home page</a>. We hope to expand our scope to other parts of the nineteenth-century globe as the project develops.</p>
		
		<p>Encoded transcriptions are available for viewing online in facsimile versions that approximate the textual, structural, and material characteristics of the originals. Users can also download original TEI XML files (and related XSL and CSS files) from the <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/One-More-Voice/tree/master/Transcriptions" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> for <span class="italic">One More Voice</span>. If you use our critical editions in your work, please credit our project as appropriate by using the citation template provided at the end of each online transcription.</p>
		
		<p>The list below includes names of authors and other contributors, corresponding dates, and brief biographical statements. Unattributed authors and contributors, where known, are given in square brackets. Bulleted information following the title of the item describes the form that the non-European contribution(s) takes in the given item.</p>

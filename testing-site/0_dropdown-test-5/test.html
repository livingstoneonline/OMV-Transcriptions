		<p><span class="bold site-blue">Analytical Priorities</span></p>

        <p>The <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> project grows out of the fact that non-European contributions survive in abundance in nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives.</p>

		<p>By building on such work, our team has been able to engineer a site development method that is self-empowering and replicable, that allows for contributions from scholars with a range of technical competencies, and that results in online scholarship that can be consulted from a wide variety of devices and by individuals with varying degrees of bandwidth. The approach is cost effective as it prioritizes the reuse of existing digital materials and tools, thereby enabling us to work quickly (relatively speaking), while making it possible to develop as much of the site “in-house” as possible. Additionally, minimal computing has allowed our team to create a project that is easy to maintain and sustain long-term because of its simplified file structure and small digital footprint (except for a few PDF files, the entire site is less than 10 MB). Finally, our site development method underscores the long-term value of relevant prior work because the method shows that such work can be extended into new contexts, not all of them anticipated by the original creators.</p>
		
		<p>In this spirit, we have also turned to an agile publication strategy. <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> does not have a project team, but rather has been conceived of as a way of integrating the work of a series of <a href="contributors.html">contributors</a>. As a result, our publication strategy focuses on the production of high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship, but prioritizes the creation of short-form critical <span class="italic">interventions</span>, a term inspired by Matt Gold and Lauren Klein's use of “provocations” as a way of characterizing the short essays published through the <a href="https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">Debates in the Digital Humanities</a> book series. The emphasis on such interventions extends our minimal computing approach to the realm of critical argument, but also opens a practical, reduced-commitment way for individuals to contribute to our site and stay active professionally at a time when many are distracted by the Coronavirus pandemic or working under challenging conditions, and when access to the kinds of archival sources often required for longer-form scholarship has been curtailed.</p>

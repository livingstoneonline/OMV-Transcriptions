# One More Voice
One More Voice (https://onemorevoice.org/), a work of digital humanities scholarship, focuses on recovering non-European contributions from nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives. The name reflects the fact that there is always one more voice to recover from the archives. The non-European contributions take multiple forms and appear in multiple genres, including travel narratives, autobiographies, letters, diaries, testimonies, interviews, maps, oral histories, genealogies, and vocabularies. One More Voice attempts to offer a critical and systematic evaluation of this rich and diverse material by using interpretive approaches and digital preservation techniques that extend existing scholarship on the topic.

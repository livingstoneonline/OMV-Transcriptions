Later, it was also used less precisely by some contemporary commentators to refer to any Kimbundu-speaking traders in Portuguese Africa who behaved in ways regarded as &#34;European&#34; (Fish and Fish 2002:76, Dias 1986:292-93).">Ambacistas</span> and ever since

In the late 1750s, he persecuted the Society of Jesus in a bid to secure his power, imprisoning some of its members while deporting most of them to Rome. Following the death of King Joseph and the coronation of Maria I, he was tried for abuses of power and subsequently exiled from Lisbon (Domingues 2016).">Marquis of <span class="settlement town" title="A town.">Pombal</span></span>

During his transcontinental expedition (1852-56), Livingstone was hopeful that the Zambezi could provide a highway into central Africa, but during his later Zambezi Expedition (1858-64) he realised that he had overestimated the river's navigability.

Livingstone sometimes mistakenly refers to the Kabompo River as the Leeambye (another name for the Zambezi River), since he incorrectly believed the Kabompo to be the main stream of the Zambezi rather than a tributary (Schapera 1963,1:27n3).">Leeambye</span></p>

A London Missionary Society mission to the Makololo in the 1860s resulted in the majority of the members dying from fever, with Sekeletu wrongly suspected of having poisoned the party.

Although based on limited information and mistaken geological premises, his theoretical speculation proved largely correct. Livingstone came to the same view of Africa's continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison's proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857aa:475, 500; Schapera 1963,2:314).">Central valley</span>

Renamed Kuruman, this station became the centre of southern African missionary activities.

When Zwide was defeated by Shaka in 1818, Mzilikazi joined the AmaZulu empire. Splitting with Shaka around 1820, he migrated north, conquering and assimilating a range of groups. Following collisions with Afrikaners in the Transvaal, he founded his kingdom, Matabeleland, in present-day Zimbabwe around 1840. Mzilikazi consolidated his state using military and political methods learned from the Ndwandwe and AmaZulu (Musemwa 2012:277-78, Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:167-68).">Mosilikatse</span> the <span class="region" title="Mashonaland.

Although based on limited information and mistaken geological premises, his theoretical speculation proved largely correct. Livingstone came to the same view of Africa's continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison's proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857aa:475, 500; Schapera 1963,2:314).">central basin</span>

Although based on limited information and mistaken geological premises, his theoretical speculation proved largely correct. Livingstone came to the same view of Africa's continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison's proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857aa:475, 500; Schapera 1963,2:314).">central

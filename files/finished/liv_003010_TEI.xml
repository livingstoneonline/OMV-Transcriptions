<lb/><p rend="no-indent">After spending some sixteen years <subst><del>of m</del><add place="over-text">in</add></subst> teaching
<lb/>honesty to the <orgName>Africans</orgName>, it was rather mortifying
<lb/>to one whose contact with foreign nations
<lb/>had revived high ideas of the honour of his countrymen
<lb/>to <del type="strikethrough">encounter on</del> witness on his return home a
<lb/>cool appropriation of his literary property which
<lb/>would have made the <term type="tribe" ref="ethic-group.xml#ethnic0082">Makololo</term> hold in their 
<lb/>breath - <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>When slowly toiling through forest, marsh
<lb/>and river pains were taken in spite of ever
<lb/>returning <term type="ailment">fevers</term> to convey home by means 
<lb/>of general sketches the earliest information
<lb/>of the discoveries, in order that should the
<lb/>writer, as so many have done, fall a victim
<lb/>to the climate, his labours might not be lost
<lb/>to his countrymen - At a meeting of welcome
<lb/>held a few days after my arrival in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> in

<lb/><persName ref="people.xml#pers0580">Sir Roderick Murchison</persName> proposed that I should
<lb/>give a narrative of my travels to the world - And
<lb/>at a similar meeting by the <term type="occupation">Directors</term> of the
<lb/><orgName ref="orgName.xml#org0064">London Missionary Society</orgName> I stated my intention
<lb/>of doing that instead of making those public
<lb/>appearances which were urged upon me - My
<lb/>resolution was <subst><del><unclear cert="medium">th</unclear></del><add place="over-text">w</add></subst>idely known yet no long
<lb/>time elapsed before artful advertisements
<lb/>were issued the aim of which was to produce
<lb/>the impression that various spurious <subst><del>pro</del><add place="over-text">wo</add></subst>rks
<lb/>concocted from the sketches referred to - from
<lb/>some private letters the loss of which could
<lb/>never be accounted for - and from the

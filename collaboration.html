				<h3>Collaboration</h3>

				<p>The <em>One More Voice</em> project welcomes external collaborators. We are particularly interested in promoting new interdisciplinary frameworks for interpreting Victorian literature and in supporting the work of BIPOC/BAME scholars, early-career scholars, and contingent faculty. However, we encourage anyone interested in becoming part of the project to <a href="mailto:awisnicki@yahoo.com">contact us</a>.</p>

				<p>To facilitate the work of new collaborators, we have developed what we term an <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/project_design.html#link-2">agile publication strategy</a>. At the core of the strategy is a focus on short-form scholarship. Such scholarship (and collaboration with the <em>One More Voice</em> project more generally) can take a variety of forms. These include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

				<ol class="concept-list">
					<li><em>Identifying relevant primary materials</em> by consulting archival catalogues and online databases, including commercial databases. The primary materials thus identified might be included in our <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/bibliography.html">bibliography</a> or, eventually, published in <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/texts.html">critically-edited and encoded form</a> by the project;</li>
					<li><em>Encoding relevant primary materials</em> for online publication by encoding them using our light weight <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/coding_guidelines.html">TEI P5 guidelines</a>;</li>
					<li><em>Writing short introductory essays</em> for the primary materials <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/texts.html">published by our project</a>. Such essays might focus on historical author and contributor biographies (e.g., the <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/html/essays/introduction_read_jr.html">biography</a> for James Read, Jr.) or related historical contexts, or might take up analysis of the primary materials themselves. We are also happy to consider other approaches proposed by potential contributors;</li>
					<li><em>Writing more abstract essays</em> that do not focus on specific authors, texts, or historical contexts, but rather engage theoretical and conceptual issues related to the <em>One More Voice</em> project as a whole;</li>
					<li><em>Creating digital exhibitions</em> that combine a range of <em>One More Voice</em> <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/texts.html">primary materials</a> with integrated, overarching analysis;</li>
					<li><em>Capitalizing on the digital form</em> of <em>One More Voice</em> to develop innovative analysis of our primary materials using digital humanities methodologies. Contributors along these lines might already be conversant in such methodologies and willing to help us incorporate them into the project. However, if contributors don't have relevant expertise and/or we can't provide it either in-house via our range of professional contacts, we are also willing to try develop such expertise ourselves, per the general principles of self-empowerment set out on our <a href="https://onemorevoice.org/project_design.html">project design</a> page;</li>
					<li><em>Helping us invite project participation</em> from scholars, students, university departments, and other academic environments around the world, especially those beyond Europe and the United States with historical links to the British Empire;</li>
					<li><em>Assisting us in promoting</em> <em>the </em>One More Voice<em> project</em> through social media, print and broadcast media, and other such avenues;</li>
					<li><em>Helping us organize presentations and panels</em> that take up topics and materials related to the <em>One More Voice</em> project. These presentations and panels might be arranged through conferences, academic associations, or local university interest groups. For the foreseeable future, we imagine that such events will be online due to the coronavirus pandemic, but we’re also happy to discuss future initiatives, when in-person interaction again becomes feasible;</li>
					<li>For those associated with archival institutions, <em>helping us identify institutional primary materials</em> directly relevant to the <em>One More Voice</em> project and/or arranging for those materials to be digitized and provided for incorporation in the site.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>In short, <em>One More Voice</em> offers multiple options for becoming involved. The list above is just a starting point, and we are also open to other, innovative methods of collaboration. Whatever the option, we encourage individuals to <a href="mailto:awisnicki@yahoo.com">contact us</a> to discuss their ideas or even to engage with us in brainstorming sessions about possible project contributions.</p>

				<p>Our overarching goal is to produce high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship while enabling scholars and students to remain intellectually active during a challenging public health crisis when resources and access to archives are limited. All pieces published by the <em>One More Voice</em> project will undergo peer review and copy editing by existing contributors to the project. However, we are also happy to arrange – as needed by our contributors – for anonymous peer review of submissions by scholars and other relevant professionals not formally associated with the <em>One More Voice</em> project.</p>

				<p>We thus invite you to browse the <em>One More Voice</em> site, explore the materials we publish, and consider becoming involved in the project. If interested, please send us a <a href="mailto:awisnicki@yahoo.com">short email</a> to begin the conversation.</p>

				<p><strong>Header image commentary</strong>: This image alludes to the fact that <em>One More Voice</em> has been designed and developed with a wide range of audiences and collaborators in mind. The site is fully responsive; works equally well on smaller handheld devices (such as the phone pictured here) and desktop computers with large-screen monitors; and has been tested on different browsers across Linux, Mac, and Windows systems. The site's reduced digital footprint enables use in low-bandwidth environments, while the inclusion of elements such semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and (for images) ALT text supports access for users with assistive devices. That said, there is ample scope for further development along these lines; suggestions for further enchancing the site are highly encouraged and, indeed, represent an additional way individuals might contribute to site development.</p>

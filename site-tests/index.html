        <p><span class="italic">One More Voice</span>, a work of digital humanities scholarship, focuses on recovering non-European contributions from the nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives. The name reflects the fact that there is always <span class="italic">one more</span> <span class="italic">voice</span> to recover from the archives. <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> has been created and published by members of the <a href="https://livingstoneonline.org/" target="_blank">Livingstone Online</a> project team. However, the release of the present site, in an early and as-yet-developing form, responds to the changes wrought by the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">2020 Coronavirus pandemic</a>. The site gives the team members a chance to focus their energies on a topic of interest, while making a positive public contribution during a major global challenge. All original critical and critically-edited primary materials are released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> license and are available for immediate use in the classroom, in scholarship by others, and in other educational contexts.</p>

        <p>Put another way, the publication of primary texts and supporting materials in this digital form represents an instance of Rapid Intervention Scholarship for Education during an Unprecedented Pandemic (RISE-UP). Such publication has been made possible by producing new scholarship while applying <a href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing</a> principles and reusing open-access code and digital tools from <a href="project_design.html">other relevant projects</a>. Given these affordances, the project team recognizes that there is considerable room for improvement in our work, and we welcome outside contributions. We are actively searching for new collaborators, especially scholars and students whose backgrounds link them to areas that historically fell under the sway of the British Empire in the nineteenth century. If interested, please <a href="mailto:awisnicki@yahoo.com">contact us.</a></p>

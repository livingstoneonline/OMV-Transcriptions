		<p><span class="bold site-blue">Texts: Primary and Supporting Materials</span></p>
		
		<p>At present, <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> publishes a small selection of primary and supporting materials; all of these currently relate to nineteenth-century Africa. The materials include: critical introductions; critically-edited and encoded transcriptions; and PDF-based images of relevant public domain works. Each item is presented in a form ready for educational use, as noted on our <a href="index.html">home page</a>. We hope to expand the scope of this project to other parts of the nineteenth-century globe as the project develops.</p>

		<p>The list below includes names of authors and other contributors and corresponding dates. Unattributed authors and contributors, where known, are given in square brackets. Bulleted information following the title of the item describes the form that the non-European contribution(s) takes in the given item. Encoded transcriptions are a) available for viewing online in facsimile versions that approximate the colors, structural features, and material characteristics of the originals; b) as plain text PDF files; and c) as downloadable TEI XML files. If you use these documents in your work, please credit the <span class="italic">One More Voice</span> site as appropriate.</p>

                           <p class="p ">He left <span class="">Zanzibar</span> in the month of <span class="">September, 1831</span>, and landed
                              at a town called <span class="">Boramy</span>,<span class="">✝</span> on the <span class=""><span class="">African</span> main</span>, situated a little
                              to the southward of the <span class="">south end of <span class="">Zanzibar</span></span>. After remaining
                              there for some days, he left with a caravan, or kafila, of about five
                              hundred persons. He had about seventy of his own followers; the
                              rest consisted of returning Manmoises. The first day he travelled
                              a distance of about 9 miles, on a plain road, where, at half that
                              distance, they crossed a small river called <span class="">Mazinga</span>.<span class="">☨</span> Putting
                              up at the village of <span class="">Qua</span>, which is the principality of a tribe called
                              Mazeamoo.<span class="">§</span> The next day travelled, about the same distance, to
                              <span class="">Beonee</span>;<span class="">||</span> and the next day to a village called <span class="">Ma Kunda</span><span class="">¶</span>
                              —during this journey crossed over a hill: next stage arrived at
                              <span class="">Konjee</span>, and then at <span class="">Moktanero</span>, near which is a river about 200
                              yards broad, infested with alligators and hippopotami. The next
                              night slept at <span class="">Deejamora</span>; the next stage passed under a high
                              range of hills without vegetation, the road being sand, and which
                              has been the case from the time they left the <span class="">coast</span>; passed
                              <span class="">Kedonda</span>, and slept at <span class="">Onegata</span>, where two large rivers join; slept
                              at <span class="">Datomee</span>. Passing between two high hills at this place there
                              is another tribe called Koto.<span class="">**</span> Again slept at <span class="">Zohgomero</span>, where

                           <p class="p noindent">there is a small creek or river; continued travelling for 6 days,
                              through various ranges of hills, through the <span class="">country of the tribe of
                                 Loamby</span>. The next two days passed the town of <span class="">Kesunga</span>; their
                              king is called <span class="">Keringawarha</span>, who is an usurper; the name of the
                              tribe is Wamefee:<span class="">*</span> this is all a hilly country. From thence
                              travelled 2 days to <span class="">Marora</span>; the king's name is <span class="">Negaboo</span>; the
                              name of the tribe Osagara<span class="">✝</span> (many sold in <span class="">Zanzibar</span>): at this
                              place there are two rivers which irrigate the country, and food in
                              plenty; there are also numerous running streams from the hills.
                              From <span class="">Marora</span> in one day reached the <span class="">Bahar</span> (the river, viz. the
                              <span class="">Lufígi</span>?): there is a large river, called <span class="">Matoney</span>, infested with
                              hippopotami; travelled close to the banks of the river for 8 days, 
                              through the tribe called Yoaha:<span class="">☨</span> the country is hilly; and we
                              were constantly falling in with villages, at which we slept every
                              evening; when we got to <span class="">Powaga</span>. Travelled thence, through a
                              plain country, on the banks of the same river for 5 days longer 
                              till we reached <span class="">Osanga</span>; from thence proceeded to <span class="">Sanga</span> in 3
                              days, leaving the river <span class="">Matoney</span> on our left hand, the hills were also
                              all left to the south; and the other part of the country was perfectly
                              level, principally sand and ironstone: thence travelled for 5 days
                              through the tribe of Toomba; the country quite plain, and well
                              populated—during the whole time from leaving the <span class="">coast</span> had no
                              rain. From <span class="">Toomba</span> to <span class="">Jangwera</span> 2 days; thence to <span class="">Sangara</span> 3
                              days: no villages or people. <span class="">Sangara</span> forms the <span class="">east limit of the
                                 Manumuse (Mono-moezi) tribe</span>, and one of the kings lives there;
                              from this to the lake is occupied by the Manumuse (Mono-moezi) 
                              tribe, which is under four independent sovereigns: the people are
                              very honest and civil to strangers; no instance has occurred of ill
                              treatment or injury. The road to the lake is plain, without hills. 
                              <span class="">Sangara</span> to <span class="">Ganda</span> 5 days, quite plain, country well populated, more
                              so than before entering the <span class="">Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country</span>.
                              Sheep eight for one dollar, bullocks four for one dollar; but they
                              prefer a quarter of a dollar's value of cotton cloth. From <span class="">Ganda</span>
                              to <span class="">Shesha</span> 3 days; here is a sultan or king: the appearance of the
                              country as before. Hence to <span class="">Sanjee</span> 5 days; here another sheik
                              or sultan: at this place there is an abundance of iron-ore -- country
                              quite level. From this latter place to <span class="">Sagosee</span> 2 days, country
                              as before; thence <span class="">Ogaree</span> 3 days, where there is a very large river
                              called <span class="">Magrazie</span>, with numerous hippopotami in it. From this
                              place to the Grand Lake is 12 days, through a country called 
                              <span class="">Oha</span>, a plain level country: on the banks of the lake is the great 
                              <span class="">Sultan</span> of the Manumuse (Mono-moezi), whose minister's name is
                              <span class="">Kegaw</span>; the appearance of the people near the lake is that of the 
                              <span class="">Abyssinians</span>. The whole time from the shore of <span class="">Africa</span> being 140

                              62 days, at about the rate of 9 or 10 English miles daily;
                              but I have no means of ascertaining the exact distance.

                           <p class="p ">The extent of the <span class="">Manumuse (Mono-moezi) country</span> is about
                              2 months from <span class="">N.</span> to <span class="">S.</span>, and from <span class="">E.</span> to <span class="">W.</span> 1½ month. In
                              standing on the banks of the lake it can be seen across, in the 
                              same manner as from <span class="">Zanzibar</span> to the <span class="">main</span> (which is 24 English
                              miles). Several islands were observable in it. On leaving the
                              <span class=""><span class="">African</span> coast</span> we travelled in a direction for the first month about
                              two points S. of where the sun sets, and afterwards continued to
                              travel exactly in the direction of the setting sun.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p ">The river called <span class="">Magrazie</span> takes its origin from the lake, and 
                              disembogues itself into the sea between the rivers <span class="">Lindy</span> and
                              <span class="">Keelwa</span>; and I am sure the rivers <span class="">Lindy</span> and <span class="">Masoryre</span> are
                              branches from it. Across the lake there is a great trade of ivory, 
                              oil of a red colour, and slaves like those of <span class="">Nubia</span>. There is a
                              trade carried on from the <span class="">W. bank of the lake</span> to the <span class="">W. coast</span>; it
                              consists of white and blue cotton cloths, and some broad-cloths,
                              which are bartered for ivory. The time taken to reach the <span class="">W. coast</span>
                              from the lake is about 6 months. For two trassalors<span class="">*</span> of beads 
                              you get four of ivory; the beads costing about five dollars per
                              trassala.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p ">Never heard of the dwarf human species spoken of: the people
                              near the lake are fairer than those near the <span class="">coast</span>. There is a great 
                              sea or swell on the lake when the wind blows fresh: and it is well 
                              known by all the people there that the river which goes through
                              <span class="">Egypt</span> takes its source and origin from the lake. The banks of the 
                              lake are composed of sand-hills, thrown up by the waves; the water 
                              is very deep, with great quantities of fish. On the <span class="">W. side of the
                                 lake</span> the name of the tribe is Yoah; they are circumcised, and call 
                              themselves <span class="">Mohammedans</span>. Some of the boats are 6 fathoms long,
                              very narrow, and without sails. The Manumuse (Mono-moezi)
                              are pagans; and both sexes go nearly naked. Near the lake, and 
                              through the <span class="">Mono-moezi country</span> there are no horses or camels,
                              but plenty of asses and a few elephants. In travelling in the
                              country from the <span class="">E. side</span> to the lake there is no danger; and from 
                              the <span class="">W.</span>, by paying a little to the different sultans, they would
                              forward you with the greatest safety. During the whole distance
                              the people with the caravan were healthy; they got plenty of
                              good and cheap food and water. The houses on the road and
                              at the lake are made of wood, and thatched with grass; no upper 
                              stories, nor is there any chimney. Dogs are very numerous and
                              troublesome, some of a very large kind.

                           <p class="p noindent"><span class="smallcaps ">This</span> man is at present in this country: he had been previously, 
                              fourteen or fifteen years, on board of a British man-of-war; and
                              liberated from slavery about the year <span class="">1815</span> or <span class="">1816</span>. He is a
                              native of a country which he calls <span class="">Kimcoul</span>; and which, as far as
                              the accounts which he gives are correct, must be situated near the
                              <span class="">sources of the <span class="">Tshadda</span></span>, in about 10° N. and 18° to 19° E. He 
                              was exactly 68 days actually travelling from thence to <span class="">Calabar</span>,
                              and always in the direction of the setting sun. From the rate at
                              which he travelled, and the time occupied, he must have made
                              good at least 10 geographical miles daily, if not more. He states
                              that <span class="">Donga</span> was 6 days' journey, on foot, eastward from his
                              country; that he had been there, his country having been engaged 
                              in war with the people of that district; that there were
                              plenty of rivers, great and small, in the country of <span class="">Donga</span>; that
                              they were not the same as the river in his country, but ran in an 
                              opposite, or rather in a southerly and westerly direction. He was
                              very closely questioned about his knowledge of this place, and he
                              always adhered to the statement that he knew it perfectly. He
                              also stated that he had heard of a country called <span class="">Ferttee</span>, to the
                              eastward of his country and of <span class="">Donga</span>. He gave the name of 
                              every place or town at which he halted in his journey to the <span class="">coast</span>.
                              Gold and silver were abundant in <span class="">Ferttee</span>.

                           <p class="p ">In his country, he says, there is a great river called <span class="">Ayah</span>, 
                              broader than the <span class="">Thames</span>. It comes from the E., and runs to
                              the W. or the setting sun. Its course from his country passed 
                              first through a place called <span class="">Komse</span>, second <span class="">Mongell</span>, third <span class="">Pambe</span>,
                              and fourth <span class="">Mondell</span>. In his way westward he passed several rivers,
                              but all smaller, except one about midway; and they all ran in
                              the direction of and to join the Great River. This river is joined 
                              on both sides by small streams. During the dry season the Great 
                              River is about 3 feet deep. There are no canoes on the Great 
                              River: the people either swim across it or pass it on rafts. During
                              the rainy season there is plenty of hail; the children pick it up and
                              put it in their mouths as amusement, as it makes them feel cold:
                              it lies three or four hours on the ground before melting. Plenty of

                              Rain sometimes incessant throughout the year; sometimes dry.
                              Old people make rain fall—make fires and offerings to bring it.
                              Many shooting-stars or comets: these run like serpents, and explode.
                              This takes place before the kings die. Thunder and
                              lightning very heavy, and very frequent. There are plenty of
                              elephants and monkeys; the monkeys do no hard work. There
                              are plenty of cows and horses, but these are never employed in
                              work. There are plenty of sheep, goats, and tiger-cats. There
                              is also plenty of fish in the rivers: both men and women catch
                              them in nets; these nets are made of a kind of grass or hemp.
                              There are plenty of crocodiles and alligators; the people eat
                              them, and also the guana: sometimes the crocodile kills people
                              in the river. There are plenty of large trees and plenty of brush.
                              The houses are made round; they are built of mud, thatched all
                              over, and have small fire-places. They have plenty of fowls.
                              Each kind of stock live separately. They have plenty of Guinea
                              corn and Indian corn; plenty of yams and sweet potatoes of a description
                              resembling beet-root.

                              more. They have many slaves, which are either bought or taken 
                              in war. There are also plenty of yellow and brown people—God 
                              made them as well as the blacks: the brown or red coloured
                              people come with camels to buy slaves, &amp;c.; these red people
                              bring the camels in order to carry themselves and their goods.
                              His country made war with different nations—one called <span class="">Koome</span>,

                              marked like the New Zealanders. All these nations are black,
                              and speak different languages. In his country they make images 
                              of wood and worship them: they also pray to stones. The common
                              people build their images of clay. They also build a large
                              image with stone; this image only the king and courtiers worship:
                              they make him like a man, with a hole in one side in order to give

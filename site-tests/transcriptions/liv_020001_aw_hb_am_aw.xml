<lb/><milestone unit="section" rend="quarter-line center"/>
<lb/><p>I left <geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName> to travel in the <region>interior of <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> <date when="1844">about sixteen years ago</date>. I went partly to trade in ivory, and partly for the purpose of visiting unexplored regions of that great country<!--geog: Africa -->. I first travelled to <settlement type="town"><choice><sic>Ugiji</sic><corr>Ujiji</corr></choice></settlement> on the shore of the great lake of <geogName type="lake"><choice><sic>Tanganika</sic><corr>Tanganyika</corr></choice></geogName>. I then crossed the lake<!-- geog: Tanganyika -->, and went twenty-seven days' journey down its <region>western coast</region> by boat to <placeName>Umaroongoo</placeName>, which is situated near the <region>south end of the lake</region><!-- geog: Tanganyika -->. A broad river, called the <geogName type="river">Maroongoo</geogName>, flows into the lake near this place. From <placeName>Umaroongoo</placeName>, I travelled south, and visited the country of a powerful <term type="occupation">Chief</term> whose title is 'the <foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Casembe</roleName></foreign>.' I first went seven days journey to <placeName>Peto</placeName>, thence seven days to <placeName>Karembo Makoonga</placeName>; in three days more to <placeName>Karoongwesi</placeName>, and thence in three days to <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement>, a large town, where the <foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Casembe</roleName></foreign> resides. <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement> is situated on the banks of a large river called the <geogName type="river">Ruapoora</geogName>,--the stream flows North towards the <geogName type="lake"><choice><sic>Tanganika</sic><corr>Tanganyika</corr></choice> lake</geogName>. The <foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Casembe</roleName></foreign> is a Negro, by name <persName><roleName>Sultan</roleName> Chareka</persName>. The people are armed with muskets. There are plenty of <term type="animal">sheep</term>, <term type="animal">goats</term>, and <term type="animal">poultry</term> procurable at <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement>, but no <term type="animal">horses</term>, <term type="animal">horned cattle</term>, or <term type="animal">camels</term>. The markets of <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement> are well supplied with <term type="foodstuff">meat</term>, <term type="animal">fish</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">grain</term>, and <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetables</term>. There is no money: Venetian beads form the circulating medium. The people appear comfortable and contented, the country<!-- geog: Africa --> is everywhere cultivated, and the inhabitants are numerous. There are no stone buildings,--all the houses are constructed of wood or mud, with roofs of <term type="plant">grass</term> or <term type="plant">leaves</term>. The <foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Casembe</roleName></foreign> governs with mildness and justice, and the roads are quite safe for <term type="occupation">travellers</term>. After residing for some time at <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement>, I went a journey of twenty-five days to the great copper-mines; they are situated to the <region>west of <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement></region>, and the country <!-- geog: Africa --> all forms part of the <region>dominions of the <foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Casembe</roleName></foreign></region>; it is well peopled and cultivated. The copper-mines are situated in a large range of mountains; a great many people are employed at them, and the copper is taken for sale all over the country<!-- geog: Africa -->. After

smelting, about seventy-five pounds weight of copper are sold for four cubits of <term type="nationality">American</term> sheeting; iron is everywhere abundant, and the <term type="occupation">miners</term>' tools are made from iron procured in the neighbourhood. A large town called <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement> is situated near the copper-mines, it contains a greater population than <settlement type="town">Roonda</settlement>. The bazars at <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement> are well supplied with <term type="plant_foodstuff">rice</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff"><term type="nationality">Indian</term> corn</term>, <foreign xml:lang="und"><term type="foodstuff">jowarree</term></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="und"><term type="foodstuff">bajree</term></foreign>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetables</term> of various sorts; <term type="animal">sheep</term> and <term type="animal">goats</term> are plentiful; <term type="plant">cotton</term> is abundant, and is made into cloth in the country<!-- geog: Africa -->. There are no <term type="animal">horses</term> or <term type="animal">horned cattle</term>. Around <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement>, the country <!-- geog: Africa --> is generally populous, and the land well cultivated; but there are also extensive forests and mountains abounding in <term type="animal">lions</term>, <term type="animal">elephants</term>, and other wild animals. From the copper-mines, or "<foreign xml:lang="und">Masden Safr</foreign>," it is a journey of three days to <region>Waramba</region>, the country of an independent <term type="occupation">chief</term>. The town of <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement> and the copper-mines are situated in the dominions of a <term type="occupation">chief</term>, whose title is '<foreign xml:lang="und"><roleName>Manene</roleName></foreign>.' A large river, called the <geogName type="river">Rafira</geogName>, flows past <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement>, and joins the <geogName type="river">Ruapoora</geogName> to the North. I remained two months at <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement>; it is a quiet peaceable place, with very few robbers: the people always treated  me in a friendly manner, and goods of all kinds were abundant. In payment of purchases in the markets, you break a few beads off a string, and give them in exchange. There is no coined money. I suffered but little inconvenience from my ignorance of the languages of the various countries through which I passed, because the <orgName>Africans</orgName>, who accompanied me from <geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName>, acquired these languages with surprising rapidity, and always made themselves understood.</p>
<lb/><p>From <settlement type="town">Katanza</settlement>, I travelled in a westerly direction, and, after two months, reached a country called <region>Boira</region>.  The country through which I passed is divided into petty states, the <term type="occupation">chiefs</term> treat <term type="occupation">travellers</term> well, but
it is necessary to stay amongst them and gain their goodwill. The country <!-- geog: Boira --> was generally thickly peopled, and <term type="plant_foodstuff">grain</term>, <term type="animal">fowls</term>, <term type="animal">sheep</term>, and <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetables</term>, always procurable in abundance.</p>
<lb/><p>From <region>Boira</region>, I went a journey of seventeen days to "<region>Warengeh</region>:" the people of this country <!-- geog: Warengeh --> are the most barbarous I met with during all my travels; they go entirely naked, and pull out all their upper front teeth. From <region>Warengeh</region>, I travelled in two months to a country called <region>Ugengeh</region>, not far from the river <geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName>; the <term type="occupation">chief ruler</term> of this country <!-- geog: Ugengeh --> is named "<persName>Makororo</persName>:" the people are a handsome race, many are quite fair with long hair flowing over the neck, others are as black as negroes.

<fw><seg rend="left ">148</seg>	<seg rend="center small"><bibl>NARRATIVE OF <persName>SAID BIN HABEEB</persName></bibl>.</seg></fw>
<region>Ugengeh</region>, the people possess abundance of <term type="animal">horned cattle</term>, <term type="animal">horses</term>, <term type="animal">sheep</term>, and <term type="animal">goats</term>: they travel about, and carry on a considerable trade. From <region>Ugengeh</region>, I went in thirty days' journey through a fine rich country to <placeName>Lui</placeName>: there is very little forest in this part; <term type="animal">cattle</term>, <term type="animal">sheep</term>, <term type="animal">goats</term>, and <term type="animal">poultry</term> are everywhere abundant. I reached the city of <settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement>, on the shore of the great ocean in eighty-days' journey from <placeName>Lui</placeName>. I  remained at <settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement> twenty-five days, and then returned into the <region>interior</region>. I travelled about in various directions, trading in ivory, and visited the city of <settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement> three times. I resided at various towns in the <region>interior</region>; and, at length, having been absent from my own country <!-- geog:  --> for so many years, I resolved to return to <geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName>. I travelled east until I reached the river <geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName>, and then proceeded north until I reached the great lake <geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName>. I travelled seventeen days along the shore of the lake <!-- geog: Nyassa --> towards its northern end, in order to cross it at a narrow point, and I then returned to the <region>east coast</region> through the <region>country of the <term type="ethnic-group">Miyan</term> and <term type="ethnic-group">Magindo</term> tribes</region>.  The lake of <geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName> is of vast extent, a large frigate could manœuvre on it. The country all around is very rich; <term type="plant">cotton</term> grows everywhere in great abundance, and the natives weave it into cloth.</p>
<p>During all my journeys, I met with hospitality and friendship, and I intend returning to the <region>interior of <bloc>Africa</bloc></region> after arranging my affairs here. I met <persName><roleName>Dr.</roleName> Livingstone</persName> near the <geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName>, and conveyed <bibl>letters</bibl> for him to <settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement>. I have never written down anything I observed during my travels, because <orgName>Arabs</orgName> take no interest in the discovery of foreign countries, and do not care to hear of anything unconnected with the acquisition of riches.</p>

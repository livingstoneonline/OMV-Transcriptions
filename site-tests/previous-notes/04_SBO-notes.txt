Going forward with this specific manuscript, please take note of the following:

1) See how I've done the headers in your two files (<fw>). First, I'm treating all of these as an addition. Second, I almost always put a rend="small" on the <fw>, so please do that going forward as well also. 

2) This manuscript has paragraph breaks, but on occasion also a bigger space break within a paragraph to suggest a new idea. Take a look at page 3, line 5 for an example. Sometimes you coded these, sometimes not. I've implemented them consistently.

3) Please give some more consideration to how <roleName> v. <term type="occupation"> is being used. If there's a formal title for someone specific that is being used in place of that person's name, such as Major (clearly signaled as formal by capitalization in most cases), this should <roleName>, I think. If it's something that someone would do as a job, i.e., be a major, then it'd be occupation. I realize that this gets quite gray sometimes, so let's think about this more on the next round of transcription. It might also be worth doing a more thorough review (and articulation of rules) on these two tags once we've wrapped up this document.
